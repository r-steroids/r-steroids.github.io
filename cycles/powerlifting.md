This is an excerpt from a spreadsheet detailing the protocol for the testers of Brandon Lilly's Cube Method. This is a very long post, and I don't know how to link you the excel file besides an email, I thought it might be helpful to see Lilly's approach:

Ok guys, first and foremost I want to thank all of you for believing in this, and secondly for putting hard earned dollars out to be a part of something that is so new. It was a step of faith for you all, and gut check for me. So thank you for being a part of something that has been building in my head for several years now. By now I am sure you all have read over the template, and become somewhat familiar with it. If not I'll spare you the basics and you can go to blillytraining.blogspot.com and get caught up. Now, some of you will notice there are more than 10 names involved, and that is because I can actually take up to 20 with the software I have to monitor the progress, but I am only taking 15 at most, right now I think I have 12 paid testers, and one other guy is following but will not have as much direct testers. Now that the BS is out of the way, here is what I will be expecting starting this week. I want all of you to keep a log somewhere, I don't care where, if you have a blog/log already keep posting it, and please mark that you are a tester for this project. That hopefully allows you guys to become more knowledgeable about the program by answering questions about your training, and giving others feedback. We learn best by teaching others. I don't want you guys to give answers that you don't know, but people will ask questions no doubt and please feel free to answer them if you like, if you don't know the answer direct them to me. Also, if for some reason you are feeling frustrated or having problems PLEASE PLEASE address them with me first. I would like the group to have as much open conversation as possible with one another so we can answer each others questions once rather than 10 of the same question. I would like your Days set up like this so we all do the same lift on the same day but I realize that's a big task because of training groups and so on but I train Tues, Thurs, Sat, Sun. I know many of you all prefer Mon, Weds, Fri, Sun and that is fine but Ill start with Day 1 being either Mon or Tues: Day 1: Deadlift Day Day 2: Bench Day Day 3: Squat Day Day 4: Bodybuilding Day Now my philosophies are as follows and I expect that you all follow suit: *The only PR's that matter are those on the platform, and for those of you that don't compete the PR's at the end of the cycle is what we train for. You may not hit a PR for 9 weeks, but when you test them on week 10 you should blow your old PR's away. Now, for those of you freaking out right now you will have chances to PR before then, but you need to buy into the fact that a 5 lbs. PR today is ok, but I want a 20 lbs. PR later, so don't let your short term training diminish your long term results.

*Stop one set early. We all know the feeling of defeat when you are in the gym, you hit a good lift, then the next jump is iffy, we take it anyway and miss. We WILL NO LONGER MISS WEIGHTS. Make a plan, stick to it, hurt feelings. I haven't missed a weight because of strength in over 15 months. I might miss on a technical failure, but if that is the case I can reset and immediately do the weight. Check your ego at the door.

*Eat like a freaking beast. I don't want to hear any excuses as to why you aren't gaining. In five months I gained 21 lbs, and can see my abs in the morning, Jimmy gained 30, and got leaner as well, and we did not eat diet food, we ate to be strong. The nights before you lift make sure to eat big carb meals, and I suggest eating lots of carbs every 3 hours. I weigh 325 and hit maybe 200-250 grams of protein per day, but I always get close to 1000 carbs a day.

*Eat tons of good fats, coconut oil, nuts, olive oil in your shakes, almond butter, natty peanut butter, regular peanut butter, I don't care, but I am not creating marathon runners, I am out to make beasts. And lastly Chocolate milk is your new best friend, at minimum a half gallon a day. No excuses, cheapest, tastiest calories you can buy, and for those that doubt that tip, you are doubting me, Chuck Vogelpohl, Chad Smith, that I know of first hand adhering to the same rule.

*Your rep and speed day are just as important as your Max day because they are what lead to successful PR's, take them seriously, attack the weights each time you are in the gym.

*Supplements, I'm a little wishy washy on this subject, I prefer whole food first and foremost, then supplements to fill in holes. I don't want you drinking 4 shakes a day unless it is your only option and I would find that hard to believe. Like I said for $15 you can get two pounds of beef, a pound of chicken, and two boxes of pasta, and that's a pretty good day of food after your half gallon of chocolate milk. Eat like a beast, train like a beast. Multi vitamin is good, creatine, amino acids, and protein powder of course. That's about as fancy as I ever get, but I will give you a detailed outline tomorrow I'm just familiarizing you with my ideas.

*Drugs, I am talking about these assuming you live in a country where drugs are perfectly legal, and I am telling you experiences of a friend who lives in a country where steroids are legal as I in no way condone there use. But since I know many of you law abiding citizens use them, I will give you my friends drug protocol. Week 10 would be the week of competition, or your final week. This is all for reference not a demand.
