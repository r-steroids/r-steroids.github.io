# Background info

Alright guys, after months of research, and listening to your and other forums' opinions, this is my final plea for advice before my first cycle:
I'm going to begin my first cycle starting August 1st, and decided to put up my planned gear, diet, and routine for critique now so I'll have plenty of time to adjust before I begin.

## Pre-cycle stats 
**All measurements taken cold immediately after waking up.**
**Age**:21  

**Height**: 6' 2" 
 
**Weight**: 228

**Arms:**16.5" relaxed

**Chest:**46"

**Hips:**42.5"

**Quads:**25"

**Calves:**16.5"

**Forearms:**13.5"

**Waist:**38"

## Pre-cycle exercise routine

I experiment with rep ranges a lot, this past winter I tried pyramiding the big lifts, got some great strength gains (335X2 for bench for the first time, 410x5 for deads, 365x5 for squats), but as for what I'm doing right now during my cut:

</table>

As you can see, I'm trying out higher rep ranges during this cut. I've always done a mix of low and high reps, partially for vanity because of strength. This is my first time trying a purely hypertrophy routine. I make all my routines myself, I've never followed a program, so if this doesn't look like it's good for hypertrophy please tell me! Also, I'm doing lighter weight and slow, controlled reps for all of these, really focusing on the negatives of the movements.

I do cardio on my off days, where I run to the gym (about 1/2 mile from my house) and do either incline walking on the treadmill or the stairclimber for 20-30 minutes and run back.

# The Cycle
## Goals
To gain as much lean mass as possible, but bloating/fat gain is ok since it will end in December and I will have all spring to cut.  

## Gear
**Note: Thanks to the guys at gh15, I have learned that my source is unreliable. There is a chance that this gear is underdosed/bunk. If so I will quit use and cry myself and my lack of gains to sleep. Don't bother asking me via PM what source it is. Join gh15 if you want the truth behind online sources.**  
This will be a simple 12 week cycle:   
1-5: D-Bol 60/60/60/60/60 (more or less as needed)  
1-12: Test-E 500 mg/week, split into 2 doses Monday/Thursday  
13+: cruise on 250 mg/wk Test-P until my gold standard cut cycle (which can be found in the wiki).  
Multivitamins daily  
Glucosamine for joints  
Arimidex will be on hand in case sides come up.  

## Diet

#### [Diet Spreadsheets album click here](http://imgur.com/a/bRNjs)
Calories will start at 3500 because I gain weight very easily and will be adjusted when I stop gaining weight. I'm not very lean, so if I end up recomping by accident for the first week or two, I won't complain. 

## On cycle trianing
I'm going to do 3 days on/1 off so I can maximize my gym time on cycle. I will follow the following split:  
1: Back, Bi, Rear Delt: (heavy deadlifts)  
2: Chest, Tri, Abs (heavy bench and focus on flat and decline chest)  
3: Legs, Front and Side Delts (heavy delts and lighter legs)
4: Rest.  
5: Back Bi Rear Delt: (focus on lats and traps)  
6: Chest, Tri, Abs (focus on incline movements, weighted abs)  
7: Legs, Front and Side Delts  (heavy legs and lighter delts)  
8: Rest

# Logs

#### 7/21/13: pre-workout weight: 228
 Had a great back/bi/rear delt workout. Definitely had that placebo effect going, I was putting on five pounds here and there on various lifts. It's unusual for me to do multiple body parts in one day, so it was a nice change. I could go heavy on each exercise cause my muscles weren't completely dead. Diet is on point for the day (at least so far).

I don't know why everyone says you bloat on dbol, cause I've been peeing non-stop today haha. Obviously that's just from drinking so much water and not the drugs. I felt great going into my workout, which is probably why I went too heavy on most lifts and didn't hit some of my rep goals. After my workout I came home, showered, and literally just finished my first pinning as of writing this! It was pretty intense, not gonna lie. Have you seen Pulp Fiction? It felt like the adrenaline shot scene, or at least all that yelling was going on in my head. The pin didn't hurt at all (did my right glute), but I accidentally pulled it out when I tried to aspirate (fucking newbs right??) so I put a fresh needle on and redid it. I haven't collapsed, so I guess I didn't hit a vein or anything. Diet has been on point, so I'm not sure why I lost two pounds. I'm pretty sure it was a combination of water and weighing in at a different point during the day. I've been up since 4:45, so maybe being up so long caused the loss? who knows, I don't. However if my weight doesn't go up by tomorrow's workout, I'm gonna up the calories to 3750 (second spreadsheet for those following).

Well, at least I didn't lose any more weight. I was sweating like a pig during my workout, but my strength was up which was good. However, I learned one very important lesson about dbol today: Dbol+caffeine=*terrible, terrible* headache. I'm going to retire my preworkout, probably forever seeing as how I plan to blast and cruise from now on haha. Supplements are bs anyways. If you want a preworkout, buy caffeine pills; they're super cheap and have the same effect. Back to the cycle, if you're following (which I suspect no one is), you'll notice I downed the time of the cycle from 16 to 12 weeks. This isn't because I hate roids and am giving up. Quite the opposite, I want to bridge directly into the gold standard, perhaps platinum standard, cycle listed in the wiki. Hopefully this will help me reach the single digit body fat range before new years. Diet is on point, however I'm going to up the calories a bit (about 250-500, but not the spreadsheet diets at higher calories) today and tomorrow (my rest day) and see what I weigh in at on Thursday. Sorry for the rant.

#### 7/24/13: Rest Day
Last day waking up at 4:45 this week,  I'm tired, but I don't work tomorrow, so I'm going to sleep HARD tonight and hopefully feel 110% tomorrow. I still feel pretty "up" and good all things considered. I had insomnia last night, idk if that's from the drugs or taking caffeine too late, but I'm done with caffeine for now so hopefully it won't happen again. I had a very mild headache for most of the day, not sure if it's from lack of sleep or an increase in BP, but i'll keep an eye on it. PIP feels better today, really not bad at all to be honest. Diet was on point, I'm interested to see what I weigh tomorrow. 
#### 7/25/13: Pre-Workout Weight: 226
Well, it's official, I was recomping. I woke up and felt/looked a bit leaner, and was actually worried that my weight would have gone down today, but it held in there. On the bright side, strength was definitely up. I flew through my workout, which is surprising because volume-wise this is the longest of the 6. To remedy the recomp problem I'm going to skip up to the 4000 calorie-a-day diet from now on and see how that goes. If I'm gaining too slowly I'll just keep adding foods to it, which is fine by me! I don't understand people who complain about having to eat too much, I've never had that problem, which is obvious by my chubbiness. Second pin tonight, I'm looking forward to it actually cause naturally I'm not experiencing any test-related sides yet and I want to figure out whether my source is bunk or not asap. I still have another few weeks before I can make that call either way though. I'll keep you posted. I had a great pump in my lats/back today, but nothing painful.

#### 7/26/13: Pre-Workout Weight: 229 (+1)
Well, I may have overdone it with the eating haha. I'm up 3 lbs from yesterday. Honestly it's probably mostly water, however I did have some cheat foods at The Conjuring last night. That movie's bangin' btw. Felt great in the gym, I had to keep moving up weights here and there, and really underestimated my strength on incline, but I got a great workout in. Again, it felt like I flew threw the workout, I definitely had less rest time in between sets and was able to keep strength. Perhaps I'm just so used to being on a caloric deficit I forgot what it's like to have the extra energy of a bulk.
Other than a big zit on my nose, and perhaps a bit of horniness (which feels weird to talk about "scientifically" on the internet) no real acne or sides to speak of. I'm kinda hoping I get back pumps during squats tomorrow, I fear the dbol may be a bit under-dosed.

#### 7/27/13: Pre-Workout Weight: 234 (+6)
Yup, I managed to gain five pounds since yesterday. I don't know how, the only "cheat" meal I had was a beer and two krispy kreme donuts haha. I don't see how 500 calories (each kk donut is only 200 calories believe it or not) would add up to that much of an increase, so I'm going to assume I'm finally putting on the water weight everyone complains about. However, I don't know where it's going, cause I don't feel like I look bloated yet. I'm sure I'll notice it if my weight keeps going up like this though. I'm going to take progress pictures every two weeks, so a week from today I'll update the album at the top. Strength gains were great today, my shoulders hurt for a solid 10-15 minutes after this workout from the pump. I went lighter at the end so I could focus on slow, controlled movements. I went downtown last night with friends, which I normally hate since I'm cripplingly introverted, but I actually had a good time. I think it was just a mental thing though: I've read so much about people coming out of their shells on roids that I felt I should too, that sort of thing. I highly doubt the drugs were making me more "alpha" this early. Enough rambling, to the workout:

Definitely some strength increases since last week. I'm feeling good, nothing incredible though. I felt strong at the end of the workout and wanted to keep going to be honest. I might add some more next time if I feel up to it. I had painful back pumps for the last two sets of deadlifts, but they subsided like 15 minutes afterwards. Followed the diet well today, no donuts haha.

Up another 4 pounds since yesterday, although some of that is because I worked out later, and therefore had another meal before my workout. I feel bloated/full most of the day, and also fat, so I'm wary of raising the calories from here any time soon. No point in just getting fat. However, strength today was through the roof! Dbol has definitely kicked in, if there was any doubt yesterday. I think that some of the weight gain is muscle at least, my chest, arms, and traps look a little bigger. I want to work on my forearms too, as I feel they are disproportionally smaller than my upper arm.

Seemingly down a pound from yesterday, but I'm ignoring that because I lifted at my normal time, and had therefore eaten less before weighing in than I did yesterday. Strength was again awesome. I've noticed yesterday and today some little things really getting to me. It hit me today that the aggression may be more than other people's stupidity. I'm going to have to check myself in the future. No acne or gyno luckily. My muscles looked really full today in the gym, which was some great motivation. I'm excited to see where this cycle takes me. I pin tomorrow night, which is a rest day. I'm going to give quads a shot since I'm having trouble getting the glute by myself.

Another four pounds in 2 days! This stuff is pretty amazing, even if most of it is water weight. It's hard not to laugh at the gym when you can just keep putting more and more weight on the bar and get all your reps. Workout felt great today, however, I had intense pumps in my biceps and lats, which made the latter exercises difficult, which is why I didn't go up in weight on a few sets. I think it's time to invest in some taurine. Also, my grip isn't keeping up with my strength, so I may bring straps next time for shrugs and db rows. Tried pinning quads last night, it was the easiest pin so far! Went in smooth, aspirated, push it in, and pulled out. Not a single drop of blood came out. I'm definitely going to add quads into the rotation. I'm still keeping the calories at about 4000, so no need to up them yet.

I went to a concert last night, and sweated a ton, so I'm surprised that my weight stayed the same. I also missed a meal cause of it, but doesn't look like it hurt much. I'm looking pretty bloated, and my pants are definitely a bit tighter. I'm strongly considering keeping the calories here for the rest of this blast and trying to recomp. However, I don't think test is the best recomping compound. Part of me wants to just say fuck it and get fucking huge, but that means inevitable fat gains, and even more work during my cut blast I'm bridging into after this one. We'll see how I look in the next week or two. Sides update, I've got some slight acne appearing, but I've been sweating so much recently I'm not surprised. I've got acne wash that will hopefully combat the worst of it. I've had some slight aggression to, but have been able to control it. Luckily I'm a pretty passive person. I'm going to an italian all you can eat meal tonight, so I'm skipping the last two meals of the day and replacing them with this. Honestly I'll probably eat more at this place than I would between the two meals. We'll see when I weigh in tomorrow I guess.

Somehow I lost a lb from yesterdays weigh-in, which I think is because I weighed in after only 1 meal and not 2. I ate a SHIT ton at dinner last night, so I know I hit my calories yesterday. Workout was good today, nothing crazy to report. I'm going to take progress pics in the morning, but don't get your hopes up for an incredible transformation. If the measurements are as depressing as I suspect they'll be I'm going to hold the calories constant for a while, even if I stop gaining weight. If anyone has a better suggestion hit me up! Oh yeah, I almost forgot. The shoulder pumps during this workout were PAINFUL. It was miserable for like 15 minutes after I was done, and during the last two exercises.

Up 3 pounds out of nowhere. No complaints though, could be anything from food to water to fat to muscle. I'm just gonna keep doing my thing, cause things are going well so far. Well, for the most part. Today had one major flaw: BACK PUMPS. HO-LY SHIT they were AWFUL. I had to take long breaks during every set of deadlifts just to get through them. They lasted through rear delt flys, and were definitely a distraction. I think bicep pumps were the culprit in my lack of strength increase on arm exercises too. It was painful, but felt great at the same time, not unbearable like the back pumps. That being said, I still got 400x5 on deadlifts which felt freaking awesome after being weak for so many months. Energy and confidence are up, no acne or gyno. Enjoying the ride. Some slight PIP from my left quad injection I did yesterday morning, but nothing major.

Up another 2 pounds since yesterday, I can't believe I've put on almost 20 lbs in 2.5 weeks. Most of it's water/glycogen surely, but it's still awesome to see the scale move like that. The pumps are still pretty intense. My triceps got a little overwhelmed today, and my chest felt incredible after my workout. I could actually see some veins snaking from my delts to my upper chest, which is a first for me.

I can't believe I gained 4 lbs since yesterday, considering that the only thing I missed on my diet yesterday was going to a restaurant in place of one of my meals. All I had there was chicken, veggies, and a slice of pecan pie though, so I didn't think that my macro's would be THAT thrown off. I'm holding a TON of water, so it'll be interesting to see how much of this newfound weight sticks around when I stop the dbol. I'm tempted to stop it a week early, as the pumps are getting out of hand. My shoulders were killing me at the end of my workout, and my lower back hurts if I walk for any measurable distance. Other than that, I feel incredible, and I'm excited every time I step in the gym because I know I'm heavier, stronger, and going to make progress. Strength is still going up strong, and I think I'm going to do some fasted cardio tomorrow morning to see if I can shed some water weight.

Down a bit because I lifted earlier in the day. I'm started to get really paranoid about gyno. I have no acne or estrogen signs, but for some reason I can't stop checking my nipples. They aren't sore, and I can't feel a lump, but it looks so unattractive that I'm determined not to get it. I got a comment from my mom about how I've been bulking up. She asked if I like being intimidating haha. I don't feel intimidating, however people might be intimidated if they saw me at the gym recently. I've really been pushing it hard, and today I did some extra drop sets on lats and bi's to get them completely fried.

Weighed in at my "normal" time, so that's why my weight seems significantly up from yesterday. Strength was good, but I think I'm showing signs of high estrogen, so I'm going to take some of my arimidex tonight, and see if I can't get rid of some of the bloat/moodiness/puffy nips. No hard gyno or anything, but they are feeling sensitive. I'm satisfied with the weight gain, so I think I'm going to end the dbol this week. The pumps were pretty bad after squats and at the end with shoulders. Other than that things are going great! Definitely glad I hopped on. Sticking to the diet has been difficult the past few days, eating the same thing every day gets old quick. I've been mixing and matching meals from my spreadsheets in order to keep sane.

Weight leveled off for a day. I won't be dissapointed if it keeps here. I'm about ready to recomp at this point. I can literally FEEL how much heavier I am. Even things like walking around are a bit more difficult because of the rapid weight gain. This is the most I've weighed since high school, so it's been kinda cool to break that barrier at a much better body composition than I was back then. I still fit in all my size 36 pants, so I don't think I put on TOO much fat. Definitely a lot of water, and some solid muscle too. I've gotten some compliments in the last week about it as people have come back for uni that I haven't seen all summer. My elbows have been aching some from the heavy lifting. It's bearable at this point, but something to keep an eye on. Still no acne or gyno, but I'm glad I started taking .5 mg Arimidex EOD, cause it's been great for my mood. I'll probably stop after my next pill to reevaluate. Cycle's going great overall, I like to put all my complaints up here so people get a realistic viewpoint, but if we're being honest I feel fucking amazing most of the time. Definitely spend more time in front of the mirror than I used too haha kind of embarrassing. I'm excited to start recomping, and I'm REALLY excited for my tren/mast/test blast later this fall so I can really get shredded. I've never been sub-10% bf in my entire life, so it will be a big milestone for me if I reach it.

I can't believe I've gained almost 30 lbs in less than four weeks. It's completely unbelievable. And the fact that my shorts still fit around the waist is a miracle. However, they're definitely tighter, especially around the thighs and ass. I've had to retire some of my t-shirts for the time being as they've gotten too small. I pretty much have to stick to xl and xxl unless I want to look like a complete tool. Part of me feels like showing off though haha, must be the high test. I was the biggest guy in the gym today, which is an amazing feeling that I'm sure some of you can relate to. For those of you who aren't yet, just wait, you'll get there if you work hard, eat hard, and take the right gear (unless you go to a gym full of professionals). Got a new PR in bench today, and I felt incredible during the whole workout, energy was through the roof, and hitting new maxes was even better motivation.

Last dbol assisted workout. I'm interested to see if the bloat goes down any in the next few days. Probably won't be gone by picture day on Sunday. No weight gain since yesterday, but I still feel MUCH bigger since I started. Strength is still up, I'm interested to see what happens with weight/strength when it's just the test. I don't want to lose my strength gains. Things are going well, great mood/confidence. It's Friday so I'm gonna make this short.

**Arms:**18.5" flexed(+.5)

**Forearms:**14" (+.5 total)

**Waist:**41.5" (+3.5 total) Bad bad bad

I've eaten like shit the past few days, and that was reflected in my waist measurement. I'm going to recomp from here on, at least for now. I'm going to start with my 3500 calorie diet from my spreadsheets. I'm also going to switch to a 5 day-per-week plan, with each body part getting one day. I want to take a little more time to recover, because the recovery time is when the growth occurs. Glad to have gained inches in some good places too. My shirts are definitely all tighter. I wish I could measure my shoulders too because they've developed greatly the past few weeks. I noticed I have two or three new dark chest hairs, which is noticeable for me simply because I have the hair genetics of a 13 year old. My university starts tomorrow, so hopefully the firm schedule will help keep me on diet and in a routine that works. Overall I'm very happy with my results so far. I'd love to hear input, if y'all think I've just put on a ton of fat tell me, so I don't keep fucking up. Pics are in the progress album at the top. 

#### 8/19/13: pre-workout weight: 250(+22)

Dropped some of the dreaded bloat, which was nice. I also weighed in earlier than normal, so there's another reason for the drop. Felt great in the gym today, but it's packed with people now that school's started up. I definitely got some looks lifting four plates on deadlifts. 425x5 is a new PR for me, which was sweet. However, I felt pretty tired near the end of my workout because I went real hard and heavy at the beginning. Overall a great workout though. No Pumps today too!

Looks like this is where my body's going to hold for recomp, at least for now. I'm fine with that to be honest. It'll be at least 2 weeks before I'll be able to tell if I'm recomping successfully or just spinning my wheels, so I guess we'll weight and see (bad pun sorry). No sides to speak of, other than a ton of sweating in this heat, however that could be from drinking a lot of water as much as the gear. Also, I'm kind of fat, and fat people sweat, it's just a fact of life. Lifts went well, I tried out doing rear delts first as opposed to front delts as I feel my rear delts lag. Worked OK, I'll keep doing it for a while to see how it goes.

The weight gain is merely an illusion my friends, as I had my second meal (A huge plate of spaghetti) before the gym, so I appeared heavier. I did legs today, and they feel fried now, so I think I worked them pretty hard. Normally I won't lift five days in a row like this, but I'm going to be out of town from Friday night Til Sunday night, so I had to fit them all in before leaving. Tomorrow will be arms, and I'm fucking pumped for it already. I love not being able to touch my shoulders afterwards, if any of you can relate. Doing OK with the diet, but I seem to be having trouble sticking to it late in the day. I need to come up with more appetizing meals that just a plain cheeseburger. All suggestions welcome for better meals.

I was out of town this weekend, so I could only eat what was provided. At least I didn't stuff myself so that my weight wasn't thrown off. I had to skip shrugs today, but my traps are overbearing as it is, so I'm not heartbroken. Strength stalled, relatively, and I'm not sure if it's because of my diet this weekend, or if the test isn't very potent. If you recall I'm not 100% confident in my source. But at least things didn't go down.

Sorry I didn't post this yesterday, I've been super busy. Everything is going well though, strength is still steadily climbing, although less so than when on dbol, which is to be expected. Recomp is going well I think, this is my first time ever attempting a recomp, and it's a bit too early to tell. I'll post today's workout later tonight.

Weight seems down, but I weighed in earlier. It's possible I'm losing a bit, because my diet has been off, but on the low end so I'm not too worried. As long as my strength keeps going up I'm not too concerned. I'm keeping my protein intake high at least. Workout was good today, I was sweating like a pig afterwards. I sweat all the time now, and I'm not sure if it's because of all the weight gain or because I drink a lot water or because it's so hot. That aside, I feel great. I'm having a lot of fun with the test. Confidence is up, but the boys have shrunken noticeably. I don't use them, so it's no biggie right now.

Jumped up 5 lbs, which is a little disconcerting, but I'm not too worried about daily fluctuations. Shoulders today. They hurt pretty bad by the end, but in a good way. I really want to work on them, as I feel my traps overpower them pretty bad. Things are going well, nothing to report really.

Did arms today, felt a great pump, definitely worked them good. Measurements and pics on Sunday, I'm interested to see if I have made any progress. I definitely have strength-wise, but I suspect I'm  going to have to be stricter in regards to diet. Overall though I feel great.

### 9/1/13: 6 week Stats update. 
**All measurements taken cold immediately after waking up.**

**Weight**: 254(+26)

**Arms:**17.5" relaxed(+1 total)  

**Arms:**18.5" flexed(+.5 total)  

**Chest:*49*" (+3 total)  

**Hips:**44.5" (+1.5 total)   

**Quads:**27" (+2 total)  

**Calves:**17.5" (+.75 total)

**Forearms:**14" (+.5 total)

**Waist:**41.5" (+3.5 total)  

Literally all of my measurements were the same, except for a .5 increase in my hips (Squats and deads) and a 1 inch decrease in my chest, which I believe is a result of my inability to measure it accurately myself. I was attempting to recomp these last two weeks, so I was hoping the waist measurement would have budged a bit. It feels like I'm just spinning wheels, even though my strength has gone up significantly these past two weeks. I'll have to tweak my diet during these next two weeks to get better results. Pics will be added to the album today.

#### 9/5/13: Rest Day/Catch up  
If anyone reads this regularly, they'd probably think I'd've quit by now, however I had a really busy school week, so that's why I haven't updated. Progress has been steady, but not drastic. Things are going well mentally. I get a lot of meathead jokes thrown at me, more than before, so I guess that's a sign that I've made significant gains. Looking forward to cutting in October. I'll post all my workouts so far this week below.

#### 9/9/13: pre-workout weight: 259(+31)

Weight is up, not entirely sure why because I didn't binge this weekend. I had an arm workout Friday that I forgot to post, but it's not really worth recounting, although I went up in most everything. Today was back, it went well, but I miss the drastic changes that dbol brought. I feel like I'm coasting (even though i'm on 500-600 mg/week) because of it. I'll be excited to start cutting with the tren and mast in October. I went down on the lat pressdowns so that I could really focus on the muscle. I am considering dropping deadlifts or moving them, because I feel exhausted afterwords every week and it affects my lifts.

Weight is down from Monday, which is good as I'm trying to eat clean and at a slight deficit. Trying to cut some bodyfat as I wait for the tren and mast to arrive. I'm so excited for tren, reading everyone's experiences on here and gh15 has me psyched for some crazy changes, although I'm afraid of getting my hopes up too high. Today was shoulders, which went well. I feel pretty alpha in the gym, I was even bold enough to wear a wife-beater, which I never do. I had a case of aggression last night, but it wasn't over nothing. I removed myself from the situation and I don't think it was too out of hand, or anything that would make my roommates suspect it was roid rage.
Anyways, here's the workout:

I feel like I'm just staying put for right now, although my strength is going up, my weight isn't moving any. I guess I'll see for sure if I'm losing any fat when I take measurements this weekend. I'm not working out tomorrow, and measurements are first thing Sunday morning. Everything is going well, feel like a fucking beast, but a fat one. I want to see veins, so I'm just waiting for stuff to arrive!

### 9/14/13: 8 week Stats update. 
**All measurements taken cold immediately after waking up.**

**Weight**: will measure today

**Arms:**17.5" relaxed(+1 total)  

**Arms:**18.75" flexed(+.75 total)  

**Chest:*49*" (+3 total)  

**Hips:**44" (+1 total)   

**Quads:**27.5" (+2.5 total)  

**Calves:**17.5" (+.75 total)

**Forearms:**14.5" (+1 total)

**Waist:**42" (+4 total)  
I had some minor arm gains this week, I'd say the biggest change is the +.5 in the forearms. They lag behind my upper arm a bit so that's something to be happy about. I still feel fat as fuck, and am looking forward to cutting in a few weeks. I'm still new at this in regards to hormones, so I don't know if I need to up the dose, switch up the diet, or change my training to make new progress. My dad actually told me I need to stop lifting, as I'll scare all the girls away. Little does he know this is just the beginning, but I guess he'll realize that soon enough when I get to GH in a few years haha.  
#### 9/28/13: week 10 update
Hey guys, I know I died these past few weeks. My schedule has been unbelievable, and I had to prioritize. To give you an idea, as you've been seeing I lift 5 days a week without fail. This past week I lifted twice. It's been awful for motivation. Anyways, Today, well technically last night before bed, I'm starting a cut/recomp cycle of test p/tren a/mast. So this is going to be the end of my basic bulk. I put on about 30 lbs. I'd say 15-20 of it was muscle. I've gotten a lot of compliments, and everyone seems to have noticed. My clothes all fit a lot tighter, I had to retire a few shirts and shorts, and I actually have trouble scratching my opposite shoulders now because my chest/arms/shoulders have grown haha. In terms of mental/emotional sides on this stuff. Overall it's very easily handled. I didn't feel like a god, except in the gym, but for the most part I'd say I was happier on it. I definitely got annoyed at people a bit easier, but honestly I feel most people exaggerate it, it was easily managed without coming off as a dick. If you have any other questions about the effects, hit me up! I'm not going to take stats/pics, because I look the same as I did at week 8.
