# Logs

## Week 1

First time pinning 2.5ml ever. Did it in my quad and wasnt as bad as I thought it would be. Day after isn't that bad either. Wont be much going on this week because I wont be feeling much from the npp for at least a week and not much to say about dbol or drol. The pumps at the gym from it are great but I don't miss the back pumps at all. It is all liquid oral stuff and if you guys havent had it before it tastes like straight jet fuel. I would avoid it if at all possible but it is all I can get my hands on. 

## Week 2

I am starting to feel the short esters kick in for sure. Feeling really good at the gym and just in general. Up a few pounds probably from water and thanksgiving but back on the diet after two days of eating a lot. Rotating longs with quads and VG and shorts with chest and delts. Chest is not a very fun injection site but I want to avoid lats. Chest is a fairly painful site but I like being able to see what is going on and being able to use both hands so I am sticking with it. Strength has increased a bit but not too much. still a little early in the game.

## Week 3

Weight seems to have leveled out now after the few pounds of bloat so hopefully into a bit of a recomp now which I like. Dont want to get over 200 pounds right now being I want to show at 175 and being in the military and 155 at my last weigh in last year (a week out from my show) 50 pounds would for sure throw some flags. not like 45 wont :P Hopefully they wont weigh me again until I am in to my cut and below 190. long esters seem to be kicking in well and I am feeling really good. I am starting to look leaner for sure which is great. Loving NPP and EQ. Starting to take a little adex now. .5 every two or three days. Nipples have been getting a little sensitive but oh well.
