## Background Info
So the reason I am doing this cycle is to..... GET HUGE DUH!!! But I will be competing in a Men's Physique contest on March 29th and I want to get as big as I can before I have to start cutting pre-contest. I am planning to start either September 25th or Septemeber 29th. I will keep you guys updated. I am also doing this log to keep track of myself as I feel it will be easier if I have some incentive to track progress.
