Supplementation (Daily): Multivitamin, Vitamin D3, Milk Thistle Extract, Standard EC Stack, 1000mg Fish Oils, Creatine, Whey, and a very effective Melatonin/GABA Sleep Aid.

Cycle Description: I will be taking DNP at 200mg a day for the first five days, on these days I will be taking the pill before bed the night before so as to hopefully alleviate some of the sides. Upon wakeup the next day, I will take an EC stack pre-workout to combat lethargy and cravings with breakfast. After my workout, on 400mg days, I will take the second DNP pill, as well as another EC stack with my Post Workout Meal. Later on in the day I will take the final EC stack, and finally that evening, I will take the DNP for the next day as well as 50mg diphendydramine (Benadryl), and 2 Sleep Aid pills about an hour before bed. I am going to try to not eat any substantial amount of carbs (<20g) within 4 hours of sleep to try to fight off side effects as much as possible.

Training: I will be doing a standard Push/Pull/Legs 3 day split, 2x a week with 15min LISS cardio post workout, with Sunday being my off day. 

Diet: Mean Macros: Protein: 187g, Carbs: 150g, Fats: 37g, Calories: 1850. I will be carb cycling on a | Low | Low | Moderate | Moderate | High |Repeat | every 5 days. I am keeping carbs and calories low because I really want to make sure I get down to as low as humanly possible of body fat before I jump on to my cruise in a few days following! However, this is just a starting point and will definitely be adjusted throughout the cycle according to what my body is telling me!

Day 1, Friday, November 8th, 200mg:

-	Temperature: 97.5

-	Daily Log: 

Alright boys and girls, the DNP just got here today. I work the graveyard shift tonight so I am going to take my first pill right after my lift and see how she treats me all night! I will be taking a typical EC stack pre-workout, part for the pump, mostly for staying awake until 5am. Definitely excited to get going on this after hearing some reviews from some other members, so we will see how this goes! Will probably take my starting picture tomorrow after Back and Bi day, you know, so I look good as hell and because I ate a little extra today knowing I was going to hit my macros hard while on DNP to try to evoke the best results! Time to sweat!

 Update: Well guys, I took the DNP about 2 hours ago, I can already confirm that this is definitely legit DNP. I have been doing some typical cleaning stuff aroud work, mopping, picking shit up, wiping off windows, vacuuming, etc. As a result, I am sweating while typing this... not a completely uncomfortable amount, but it is definitely an abnormal amount of sweat for the amount of activity I have been doing. I am confused on one thing though, I have been told over and over again that this stuff causes lethargy, that is the exact opposite of what I have been feeling the past hour! I have been moving around at a fast pace, noticably faster than usual, singing to the music on the speakers, and have been feeling really energetic (it is 1am here by the way), so I hope this does not stop because this is definitely a good side effect!

It is now a few hours later, and I am starting to get the feel for what this is going to be like. You know that feeling you get in the exact moment that you break a sweat, well I have been getting that every 30 seconds while just sitting here in a gym that we get complaints about pretty consistently of being too cold! Not actually that unpleasant when it is 15 degrees outside, maybe this superheating deal doesn't have to be a bad thing, I am just going to be walking around in shorts and a bro tank while everyone else is in their goose down jackets, hats, and pants!

Day 2, Saturday, November 9th, 200mg:

-	Temperature: 97.0

-	Daily Log: 

So today I took the DNP after I got home from lifting at about 3:00pm. I did not feel as big of a first time pass effect from this dosage as the first night, but after downing a couple hundred grams of carbs through my last couple meals of the day, the heat definitely began to set in, not unpleasant really, but noticeable! Training that day was not lethargic at all, I actually had a really good back and bi day, maybe the lethargy people refer to only comes at higher doses.

Day 3, Sunday, November 10th, 200mg:

-	Temperature: 96.5

-	Daily Log: 

So I just woke up, and the night sweats are starting to become apparent. I slept above the covers in my pretty damn cold room, and still woke up with a sweat ring around the collar of my tank top, so i figure I sweat a pretty good bit, that, and I woke up really thirsty and no amount of water seems to be quenching this monster thirst! I accidentally over ate pretty hard last night due to smoking a little bit with my friends, but it looks like I won't be smoking for the resat of this cycle because apparently I can't deal with the carb cravings from DNP combined from the munchies. I did not do so bad because when I munch, it is on pretty damn healthy shit, for instance, what I ate last night outside of my macros was :A bagel with fat free strawberry cream cheese, rice cake chips, rice cakes with peanut butter, honey, a good quantity of peanut butter, apple, and few other things, but you guys get the point, although I did splurge, it was not that bad for me!

Well, today I am going to go lift in a bit here and then I am going to take my daily dose of DNP in the locker rooms afterwards right before work today, so for the bulk of the hottest part, I will be at work, going to bring some EC with me and hopefully I don't sweat through my work shirt haha! Will report back later! 

Definitly feeling the heat from the DNP consistently throughout the day, meaning it is fully in my system so I know I am good to move up to 400mg tomorrow! So, now I can definitely say that side affects at 200mg are minimal at best, definitely nowhere near some of the things I have heard about it! I have heard of people getting great results from running just 200mg for two weeks on two weeks off, and now that I know how minimal the sides are at 200mg, I definitely think I might try that cycle later on, but for the sake of this log and experimentation, I must increase the dosage, just once!

Still no lethargy during, before, or after a workout. If anything I have more energy in the gym, but that could have something to do with the EC stack I have been taking 3 times a day, one of which being pre-workout! So maybe the key to not getting fucked by the lethargy from DNP is EC, unfortunately for the readers, I am not going to drop the EC to find out=] I have also been doing 15min of incline treadmill walking post workout and have not been having any problems with that, again, it is the same as while not on DNP!

Day 4, Monday, November 11th, 200mg:

-	Temperature: 97.2

-	Daily Log: 

So I was supposed to jump up to 400mg today, but yesterday, I took my DNP at the usual time and put the container back in my gym bag. Well, this morning when I woke up to take my first pill today, wouldn't you know it....no DNP so I either misplaced it or lost it and have spent the last 2 hours searching to no avial, so this cycle may come to an abrupt halt. FUCK MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Fuck yea! Found my container in the back seat of my car and popped a pill in celebration! The cycle is back on motha fuckas!

Holy shit I sweat a lot last night, my girlfriend stayed over and I was just soaking my blankets haha, was making a protective barrier of dry blankets between us so she didn't notice as she doesn't know I am on gear/DNP. I don't think I am going to have time to weight myself today so don't be expecting that quite yet, but I will on Tuesday when I have a scale at my disposal! So today is my first day of 400mg, I have already take 200mg and will take the other pill tonight a few hours before bed after I have finished eating for the day, in an attempt to not drench my bed again haha! I am excited to see what the sides of 400mg are compared to 200mg because I have heard a good amount of people say they had great results from just 200mg for a week or two, so I imagine the effects from 400mg are going to blow me away, and if the sides are not that bad, I can comfortably say DNP's danger level has been incredibly overstated! Today is my day off from the gym and I am still going to keep my macros in the same place because 2200kcal is not really that much especially when taking the added caloric deficit coming from being hot as hell and sweating all day!

Well, it is almost that time, I am about to up my dose to 400mg in about an hour when I take my second DNP pill of the day, though I am viewing the pill tonight as the first one of tomorrow, hopefully the added sweat is not as ridiculous as I have heard but 400mg is twice as much as 200mg and I have been sweating a good bit and have been pretty hot all day erry day from just the 200mg, so if it goes up my an equivalent factor, this could be interesting! I have been drinking a shitload of water and will continue to do so as I don't think you can honestly drink too much and from what i understand of the human body, excess water actually aids in weight loss as well as appetite suppression so I am going to go chug some water!

-	Weight: 202lb

Day 5, Tuesday, November 12th, 400mg:

-	Temperature: 97.6

-	Daily Log:

Still haven't really noticed a difference between 400mg a day and 200mg a day. I think I may have sweat a good bit more than I have the couple of nights prior, judging from the small puddle that was left by my chest on my bed last night, but it has not been an overpowering amount of heat by any means! I have definitely been hot or near the point of sweating consistently through the past couple of days, and today may have been the most so far. I have been drinking water like crazy, I drank about 80oz during my workout alone today, which again, I got absolutely no feeling of lethargy during, I skipped cardio afterwards because fuck cardio. Have been noticing a heat spike about 30 minutes after eating anything more than like 20g of carbs, as expected! I still have not had a chance to weight myself and have not really noticed a change in my body configuration, maybe a little tightening in the trunk area, but nothing big, but that is as expected because I have heard the real results of DNP actually show up about a week after you stop taking it, so I guess we will just have to wait and see, however, i will weigh myself tomorrow morning to see if the scale shows any results!

Day 6, Wednesday, November 13th, 400mg:

-	Temperature: 97.7

-	Daily Log: 

I weighed myself today at the normal time in a little more clothes that I normally do, so that may account for the difference, but I was actually a pound heavier then before I started the DNP. Slightly confused on this, I know the full effects of DNP are shown a few days after you come off of it, but i was definitely expecting to drop a pound or two during the cycle from how well I have been eating, oh well, I will just keep doing what I am doing!

Was feeling really hot today just sitting in class, not necessarily uncomfortable, but a shit ton more than usual considering other kids in my class were complaining about how cold the building has been as of late! Maybe DNP during winter in the northern US has its perks haha! Anyways, I have taken my first DNP pill today and will be taking my second one later tonight after I lift, before work so I will be up for the majority of the night while on the DNP, and this will be right around the 36th hour after I started taking 400mg, so I should feel the hottest I have so far about an hour or two after i take my pill tonight and then stay pretty consistently that hot for the rest of this cycle! Still no lethargy before lifts or anything like that, I would very much prefer if those side effects never showed up at all, but we will just have to wait and see until I am further into the cycle I guess! At this point, I can comfortably say that DNP is not that bad, and if at the end of the cycle I have dropped the weight I am looking for, I will probably come back to this substance because I have heard it can do the equivalent of Clen/T3 over six weeks in about 2 weeks, and that is worth how hot and sweaty I have been lately!

DNP tip of the day: Don't drink a cup of hot tea with a whole shit ton of DNP in your system, it will make you sweat like fucking hell!

Day 7, Thursday, November 14th, 400mg

-	Temperature: 96.7

-	Daily Log:

So I may be starting to feel this lethargy that people have been talking about. The past two lifts I have done have just been kinda half ass. I feel good coming to the gym, feel my pre-workout EC flowing through my system and feel like I am going to rip the gym apart, then once I am in there I just don't have the energy that I did driving to the gym. It is a similar feeling to when you eat too much too soon before lifting and your body just wants to be digesting instead of lifting. Weighed myself out of curiosity today and was 202 again, which is still confusing me! The mirror is not showing much change but I might be slimming down a tad bit! The sweating and dampness continues as expected, so hopefully all of this sweating will pay off in the end but I would really like to see some results along the way!

So I kind of remembered why I am doing this DNP cycle. Not because i am looking to lose a shit ton of fat and get shredded, but mainly for experimentation and so I can have some personal evidence that I can pass on from this so I can help to stop this "DNP will kill you" circle jerk that is going around. So, I am not going to drop my calories, in fact, tonight I am testing a theory that I thought of the other day! being that DNP's fat burning potential comes from it making you hot as hell, I thought that it would indicate that you could eat an extra amount of carbs with no negative side effects as the more carbs you eat, the hotter you will get, so to test this, I just took a DNP pill and ate a shit ton of carbs. I ate a 1/2 cup of oatmeal, mixed with a banana, greek yogurt, honey, kashi cereal, and milk, probably totaling well over 100g of carbs and holy fuck am I sweating while just sitting here typing this! I think, just to make this an official cheat meal, I am going to go get me some Ben and Jerry's Froyo after this, it's going to be exceptional! Lets hope I don't eat myself to hyperthermia!

Day 8, Friday, November 15th, 400mg:

-	Temperature: 96.4

-	Daily Log:

So I think the experiment was a success. Normally when you have a bad cheat day, you wake up the next day knowing it and feeling like shit, not only because your stomach hurts but because you know you just fucked up your diet. Well, this morning, i woke up feeling great, I looked in the mirror and as I have been noticing slightly throughout this cycle, I have been getting slightly more definition in my abs, so I don't know if it is just my body looking bulky from having all the extra carbs or not, but there may be something to eating a shit ton of carbs while on DNP to make your body sweat more and lose more! However, I was sweating my god damn ass off last night while purposely drowning myself in carbs, by the way, if you guys haven't tried the Bed & Jerry's Half Baked FroYo, that shit is exactly like the ice cream but way way better for you! Anyways, I took my first DNP pill and my first EC stack right upon waking up, took a shower, made breakfast (2 egg/.5cup egg white omelette w/ ham and swiss, 1/2 cup oatmeal with 1/2 cup berries) and now I am sweating from the oatmeal haha, DNP is kinda fun. Now I am going to leave my house where it is 27 degrees outside in a t-shirt and be hot all day, this is a pretty damn good cutting substance, kinda excited I still have a week left of it, however, the rest of this is going to be a pretty strict cut so I can see how close I can get to my six pack before I destroy it with dbol!

Day 10, Sunday, November 17th, 400mg:

-	Temperature: 97.4

-	Daily Log:

Sorry I missed the past few days, just haven't felt like typing a wall of text. The DNP is feeling awesome, but I have been eating a bit too much. Pretty much had 3 smallish cheat days in a row, and I feel like a stupid fuck, but hell, that's life and it's in the past and is not going to happen again! Only got about 4 days left on this stuff and I am going to be a perfect little boy for these past few days. Going to add in as much cardio as I can manage to make up for it! Still absolutely no lethargy coming from the DNP, I have been feeling good in the gym and have been able to get my full lifts and cardio in and then some! I have been cheating, true, but the mirror has not been showing it! I eat like crazy at night, wake up in the morning, and look as slim if not more so than the day before! This leads me to believe that while the scale is not moving down, the DNP is being quite effective underneath the large layer of water weight that is there! I think a few days after I come off, I am going to see the scale drop down a good 7 or 8 pounds, hopefully more, but we will see when it happens! The sweats have kind of subsided, I am still always hot, and while my room mates or girlfriend are walking around my ass in sweatshirts and coats and freezing their asses off, I am sitting around bare foot in a tank top and shorts feeling nice and cozy! So far, I am loving DNP, and if the results come in like they are supposed to afterwards, I may have found a new go to cutting compound. Basically, I think this stuff may be better for your than Clen/T3, and it may be a massive amount more effective!

Day 11, Monday, November 18th, 400mg:

-	Temperature: 95.6

-	Daily Log:

I think 400mg might be the magic dosage! I am definitely getting the sweats and the side effects from this stuff to know it is working, but I am not getting lethargy at the gym or anywhere else, and I have not had any form of sleep problems other than waking up to my alarm with a nice layer f sweat covering me! Now, if the scale shows I have lost a lot in a few days after the cycle, I think I am going to have to highly suggest the 400mg dose of this stuff!

Day 12, Tuesday, November 19th, 400mg:

-	Temperature: 97.4

-	Daily Log:

So, last night was the first night that the sleep problems associated with DNP really hit me hard! I was awake every 2 or 3 hours, and was covered in a layer of sweat, my pillow was soaked and luckily I have a king size bed so I could switch spots and let the old spot dry off! It was pretty damn miserable, so hopefully that doesn't happen again!

Somewhat off topic, but I had a Chest, Shoulders, Tris day yesterday and I kicked my own ass for like three hours in the gym! I woke up this morning, and my chest has not been this sore since I started to get into lifting! I seriously could not push myself up out of bed! I love being this sore, even though I know there has not been a scientific correlation between soreness and muscle growth determined yet, I truely believe that being more sore is directly related to more gains, so I feel really fucking good today!

I woke up and needed to do some studying for A&P, so I jumped outta bed, hopped my sweat covered ass in the shower, and then took a EC stack, my DNP, and my typical morning supps. I went to the kitchen and made some tea, which may not be a good idea to drink unless you want to sweat through a shirt because drinking something hot on DNP seems to be a one way ticket to sweat stains, but it all works because about 20 minutes ago I was cold and wearing sweats, now I am sweating and shirtless... thanks DNP, you're the best! I won't be lifting until later tonight before my graveyard shift and then will be taking my second dose post workout, prior to my shift so I can be sweaty all night! I think I am going to take 40mcg of Clen after my workout too just to get some extra fat burning and to help me stay awake throughout the night!

Day 14, Wednesday, November 21th, 400mg

-	Temperature: 97.4

-	Daily Log:

Well that's it then, I took the last two caps of my DNP at once, so basically my last 2 days were 600mg and I can definitely feel the difference as I am typing this right now! All of my roommates are complaining about how cold it is, my thermostat is not heating up and the internal thermometer is reading 48 degrees Fahrenheit. Wouldn't you know it, I am sitting here in a tank top and gym shorts sweating my ass off! Haha, all in all, this cycle was not that bad! Never got bad lethargy from the DNP, was always sweaty but it was not terrible, the water weight stayed on throughout the entire time so I am excited to see where I sit in a few days when it drops! I definitely can see some changes, my abs are coming closer every day to actually being considered abs rather than pudge with a little definition behind them so I am really excited about that. If the results come in like I hope, I will have no problem returning to DNP one day, but probably only if I need to drop some weight and fast, i think I still prefer Clen/T3 for a 6 week cycle because it allows you a little more freedom, I believe it is more safe, and I think you can get better results in six weeks of that than 2 weeks of DNP, however, i am not considering doing 6 weeks Clen/T3 and then in the 2 weeks off from clen running DNP, I feel like there is no better cutting stack than that! Well, that's it for now, will report back in a few days with some stats and a post cycle picture to wrap everything up, thanks for reading, if there is anyone actually reading this besides DL!=]

Post Cycle Log ( 4 or 5 days after last pill):

Update: November 27th

Okay, so I believe the water weight from DNP has dropped off, the side effects are completely gone, so my internal thermometer seems to be back to normal,  am sleeping well, my pee is actually clear again, my and my throat is no longer the sahara fucking desert! However, the water weight never really went away, because 2 days ago I started dbol @ 50mg a day and the bloat of that has put me above 210lbs, so I actually got a lot heavier before seeing the results of the DNP, however, the post cycle pic I have does show some progress that I think was pretty good for 2 weeks of terrible dieting and almost no cardio!

All in all, I didn't think DNP was that intolerable, but I only went up to 600mg, and i really started to notice the sides at that, I don't personally suggest going up to 800mg after feeling how hot 600mg was, how terrible the sleep i got was, etc. I am not sure if I will do DNP again, I am going to do another Clen/T3 cycle at the end of my blast I just started and I am going to compare the results of that to this 2 weeks on DNP picture-wise and if I think the 2 weeks compares to the 6 weeks, I might get some crystal DNP and try another cycle where I am at 600mg for more than 2 days at the end! Ok, that is all, if you have any more questions feel free to PM me, and the post cycle pic is below!

http://i.imgur.com/AYh9lD3.jpg

Edit: Looking at them side by side, I now realize they are pretty similar, i don't see much results personally, kinda unfortunate, but that is what you get when you really aren't interested in cutting and find yourself in a cut cycle on a really hard core cutting compound! Now I am going to go get bulky on dbol, deca, and test E
