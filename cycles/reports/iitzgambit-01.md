# Logs

## Week 1

Started my first pin today honestly not expecting any noticeable results until 3 weeks in so I'll update week by week with weight and any side effects I've gotten. Each pin has 30mg of prop, 50mg of masteron and 100mg of tren which gets pinned twice a day (Mon,Tues,Wednesday,Thurs,Sat). Unfortunately my raws got picked up by customs, due to it being diverted through Hong Kong and almost everything gets searched as they search for cheap knock off brands that come through Kong Kong, such as Beats By Dre and watches and what not. 

T3 makes me drowsy as hell and does sometimes give me a head ache. At most I'll be taking 50mcg per shot to keep side effects down. So for example if I I'm running 125mcg I'll do 50mcg in the morning, 50mcg in the afternoon and 25mcg right before bed. 

Albuterol also gives me slight headaches, however this can be combated by drinking extra water. I get the same shakes from albuterol as I do from clen and the same painful hamstring cramps. I do prefer albuterol over clen though as on clen no matter what amount of water I drink I'll always get clen cramps even supplementing taurine and potassium.   

## Week 2

Weight = 93.5kgs

So I've dropped a lot of water, hence the rapid loss of weight and definition has definitely increased. Libido is still the same, but I am getting really strong and the tren dreams are insane.

## Week 3

Wow, 91.5kgs atm and looking lean and mean. Libido has increased 10 fold due to the Masteron, veins are showing and strength is through the roof. However, I do have one weakness on Tren and that is the trensomnia. I did buy some melatonin and that does seem to be working but melatonin + tren = trippy dreams.

## Week 7

No updates due to pause in training due to personal reasons, I am however back at it weight is 90kgs and I hit my PB's on a cut which I'm pretty proud of.
