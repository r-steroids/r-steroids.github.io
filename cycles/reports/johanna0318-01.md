I’m a short 5’0 stocky female. I eat pretty decently, and I go to the gym regularly. However, losing weight is a battle for me. So I researched low doses of DNP and decided to give it a try. When I say I researched it, I mean I read every piece of information I could find on the internet. I read original case studies from the 30’s and a couple of case studies they did in the late 80’s early 90’s. I read every other person’s log that was on the internet. What I found was ‘Yeah, you can die’ – Keep in mind you can die, from Tylonal, Ibuprofen and Aspirin as well if not taken properly.  So I opted to keep my dose low and be intelligent. 
I also discovered that there are only 2 female logs. One did a pretty decent job logging through her cycle, but the other never logged after 3 days…..  I am by no means suggesting that anyone should take DNP, nor am I advocating that you should take it simply because I am having decent luck with it. I am sharing my info for others who are considering it or just curious about it.

Pre-cycle stats:

**Height**: 5'0 

**Starting weight**: 214lbs

**Current weight**: 202

**Lifting experience**: 1-2 years. 

# The Cycle: 250mg of DNP to start. On day 5 ramp up to 375mg ride it out for 30 days. Take 2-3 weeks off and start over. (My formatting sucks and I don't know how to make it better)

Goals: My long term goal is to lose 100lbs ideally. Short term, I'd like to be 50lbs lighter by May 1st.

Diet: Pretty clean. Low carb.  Lots of lean meat, lots of veggies. Nothing processed. 

On cycle training: The Bizzy diet work out. It's 45 mins, which mean I have no excuse. Day A-Upper body with cardio. Day B- Lower body with cardio

I've been doing my log daily. I'll try to update this every 3-4 days.

On top of the DNP and Ephedra/Aspirin, EVERYDAY I am taking a Multi-Vitamin, Fish Oil and Green Tea Extract supplement. Instead of caffeine with the EA stack, I’m just drinking my regular morning and afternoon coffee…… I also drink 3-4 liters of water through out the day. 
	

    Day 1: 250mg DNP w/ ECA stack
Starting weight: 214
The ECA stack was not a hit. After all the research I had done, I was concerned about a lack of energy so I definitely wanted the Ephedra. The caffeine however, made me agitated and hostile. 
My diet on day 1 wasn’t great. My kid had a regional history bee, so we ate dinner out. I did make reasonable choices, we went to Red Lobster and I stuck with salad, grilled shrimp and crab legs (with no butter) About 15-20 mins after eating, I was warm, like a just jogged a mile warm. Nothing serious, but definitely knew the DNP wasn’t bunk.
Sides: Warm after eating
