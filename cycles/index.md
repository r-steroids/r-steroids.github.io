# The Cycle  

Typical AAS usage comes in pre-planned lengths of time that a person is taking any compounds.  The idea is to achieve a set of goals and then allow the body to get back to stasis and ensure that there are no medical issues before doing it again.  There is also some controversy about possible decreased effectivity of long term use of AAS use.  Cycles range in lengths from short (8 weeks) to long (20 weeks).

There are several different items that need to be understood to execute a good cycle.

## Pre-cycle Check list
The following check list has been created to help new users ensure that all bases are covered.

1. **Cycle goals**:  What are your goals for the cycle?  The goals of the cycle are imperative to planning a complete cycle with compounds, length and recovery.  

2. **Eating plan**: How many calories are you planning per day?  If you're cutting, will you re-feed?  How often?  

3. **Exercise plan**: Generally, your recovery period after exercise will decrease.  This will allow more physical exertion while on cycle.  Try to take advantage of this to get the most out of your cycle and plan more time in the gym.  

4. **Blood work**: The hallmark of all safe cycles, blood work is required to ensure user safety. 

    **Pre-cycle**: It is strongly recommended that blood work be done before a cycle to ensure good health and to obtain an accurate measure of pre-cycle testosterone production.  

    **On-cycle**:  Depending on the length of your cycle and trust in your source, you may want to get blood work done while on cycle.  This would verify that gear is working correctly and ensure that you remain in good health.  

    **Post-cycle**: After PCT, newer users or users with unknown sources should get blood work done to ensure a return of natural testosterone production.  

5. **Gear list**: What gear needs to be purchased?  Consider planning to purchase a little more than needed as accidents (dropping a vial, etc) happen.  

6. **AI list**: Different cycles require different AI's.  It's always recommended to have one on hand, even if not actually used during cycle.  If you cannot afford an AI, you cannot afford to run a cycle.  

7. **PCT List**: Your natural production of testosterone will, more than likely, cease during cycle.  A definitive plan needs to be put into place to ensure a return to stasis and normal testosterone production after cycle.  

8. **Pins, storage and disposal**: How many pins do you need?  How will you store them?  How will you dispose of them?  [Find out how to legally dispose of your pins.](http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/industrial/medical/programs.htm)

9. **Questions**: During cycle you will probably gain a lot of mass.  You may have friends and family ask how you are doing it.  Be prepared to answer these questions.  

10. **Clothes**: Yes, you'll probably need some new ones while on cycle.

## Planning the Cycle

When planning your cycle, you will need to know how much of each substance you will be using for the entire duration of the cycle.  It can greatly help to [plot your blood levels](https://www.steroidplanner.com/) of the various compounds.

### Calculating Total Amount Needed

1. To calculate the total amount needed to be purchased:

     X mg desired * number of days / week(s) * number of weeks total = total amount needed 

2. Calculate the total mg per vial:

    total ml * #mg / ml  = total mg per vial

3. Then calculate the vials needed:

    total needed / mg per vial = total vials

4. Round up and add one to be sure:

    total vials, rounded up +1 = total purchase amount

#### Example

**1-12 Test Prop 150mg EOD  
Source provides 10 ml vials of 100mg / ml Test Prop.**

1. To calculate the total amount needed to be purchased:  

    150 mg * (7 injections / 2 weeks) * 12 weeks = 6,300 mg total needed

2. Calculate the total mg per vial:

    10 ml of 10g mg/ml vial = 10 ml * 100mg /ml = 1000 mg per vial

3. So for a Test P cycle, 150 mg, EOD:

    6,300 mg / ( 1000mg / vial ) = 6.3

4. Round up and add one to be sure:

   (6.3 round up =) 7 + 1 = 8 total vials needed

### Calculating Dosage

Most vials come in 10ml vials.  The label will typically tell you the number of milligrams per milliliter (mg / ml).  For example, a vial of Testosterone Propionate can come in a 10ml vial with 100mg / ml.  That means that the entire vial contains 1000mg of the substance.  If you want to inject 150mg of the substance EOD, you will inject 1.5ml.

    X mg desired / (N mg / ml) = Total ml needed per injection.

For a Testosterone Propionate vial at 100 mg / ml and a user wanting 150mg E0D:

    150mg / (100 mg / ml) = 1.5 ml

For a Testosterone Ethanate vial at 250 mg / ml and a user wanting 150mg E2D:

    150mg / (250 mg / ml) = .6 ml

## Finding A Source

// As is posted everywhere, **this forum is not the appropriate place to look for a source**.  There are multiple other ways to find a source; Reddit is not one of them. Asking will result in a ban from r/steroids.

## Blast and Cruise
Some users decide that they do not want to waste time with PCT, and instead want to keep using steroids for a longer period. What they will then do is run a cycle (blast), and then run a TRT dose (cruise). This allows the body to heal from the stress placed under it during the blast, allowing the liver/kidneys to rest and letting their cholesterol normalize. Once they are back within healthy parameters, they may then proceed to do another blast. 

This allows you to avoid going through PCT, which in and of itself is rather harsh on the body. This also prevents the muscle loss often seen in PCT. There are downsides, of course. You will likely be either infertile or have a very low sperm count during this period, and the longer you stay on the higher the chances are of you staying that way should you PCT. These cases are rare, but it has happened.
