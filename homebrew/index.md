# Homebrew

Steroid homebrew is the process of brewing steroidal compounds on a small scale for personal, non-commercial purposes. It gives the user total governance over the substance being taken, both positively and negatively. 

>**Preamble**

>*Everything you see on this subreddit has the potential to be dangerous. If you fuck something up or get bad gear, you may see effects ranging from nothing, to bitch tits, to dying (and I'll laugh at you for being a dipshit). Every piece of advice you read here carries with it some risk. Keep that in mind, and research before putting anything in your body.*

>I started this as a response to the thread by /u/hypnotoadIRL [+3][2] , so he gets partial credit.
I am a firm believer that everyone should know how to homebrew, so that they are not beholden to UGLs. Of course, not everyone wants to brew, but if you're here and you're curious, what is outlined below should help you get started. Links were all valid at time of posting. [...] You don't have to be super clever.

## Materials

####**Absolute Minimum**

This is if you plan to make your gear in a pot on the stove like the gym bros on some other forums do. DO NOT ACTUALLY COOK THE OIL. You're on the stove because heat makes it easier for the hormone to suspend.

* Stove
* Small pot
* Spoon (to stir)
* Sterile syringes
* .22 micron syringe filters
* Sterile needles
* Pre-sterilized vials

####**Recommended**

This is if you want to actually do it right, while still being economical in the materials you need to purchase.

* Glass cylinder, 500ml
* Spoon to stir
* Milligram scale
* Graduated cylinders - 5ml/50ml

If Syringe Filters

* Sterile syringe
* .22 micron syringe filter
* Sterile Needle

If Bottle Top Filters

* Glass media bottle
* .22 micron bottle top filter
* Vacuum pump (options listed in the filtering section)

I did not include vials in the materials list because there would be too many "if" statements and it would end up a large confusing flow chart. Determine your vial needs by "Vials" section.

## Sterilization Techniques

Sterilization refers to any process that eliminates, removes, kills, or deactivates all forms of life and other biological agents present in a specified region, such as a surface, a volume of fluid, medication or compound.

####**Steam (autoclave/pressure cooker)**

Using steam is a more effective way of sterilizing your vials as steam transfers heat at a much more efficient rate. Typically an autoclave is preferred, as it has an automatic dry cycle. I use a pressure cooker, and for those of you skeptical, here's a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12267939). And another [study](https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/adint.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/NewsArticles/Use_of_pressure_cookers_for_.pdf).

1. Get your pressure cooker/autoclave. If using a pressure cooker, use at least 15psi.
2. Place empty vials AND rubber stoppers into device. Glass media bottles will also need sterilized. (we cannot dry heat sterilize the rubber stoppers because well... 400* of oven heat)
3. One cycle of an autoclave, 20 minutes once the pressure cooker reaches 15psi.
4. I find there is some condensation on the vials when I pull them from my pressure cooker, I just nuke them in the microwave for a few minutes to get rid of this. (It's sterile water at that point). If you want, you can bake them in the oven at 400* until the condensation is gone. (I have moved from the microwave to baking them, microwave still works fine though)

####**Dry Heat**

1. Collect the vials and the receiver bottle (if using the glass one recommended. If you use the plastic one included with some filters it is already sterile) you plan to fill, then grab some more. Sometimes something gets in the vial, you didnt rinse all the alcohol off, etc. Errors happen.
2. Place the vials in a bath of your isopropyl alcohol. If you want to be thorough, get a small brush and go to town.
3. Transfer one vial at a time to a bath of distilled water, make sure to thoroughly rinse off all alcohol. If there is still alcohol on the vial when we put it into the oven there will be a film on the vial.
4. Preheat your oven to 350-400*F while you finish preparing the vials.
5. Get a small, flat baking pan and line the bottom with aluminum foil.
6. Place the vials, opening up, onto your foil.
7. Cover the vials with another piece of tin foil. Do not connect the sides, any evaporating water will need somewhere to go.
8. Set a timer for 30 minutes using 400, 45 minutes for 350. I would not recommend over 400. I have had a vial or two break at 400, I can only assume that more will break at higher temps.
9. During this time, continue the rest of your brewing process.

## The Brew

**BA** *(Benzyl Alcohol)* - Used as a sterility agent within the brew itself. This prevents bacteria growth once the vial has been punctured or stored for an excessive amount of time.  
**BB** *(Benzyl Benzoate)* - Used as a solvent, this allows higher concentrations of steroid powder to dissolve into the carrier oil.  
**EO** *(Ethyl Oleate)* - Also a solvent, but allows for higher concentration brews than using BB alone.  
**Guaiacol** - A solvent used for extremely high concentration brews. Using this typically results in increased post injection pain.

In order to homebrew your own steroidal compound, you must have, at minimum, the following: 

* Carrier Oil
* BA
* BB
* Steroid Raw Powder

####**The brewing process**

1. Grab a clean container (preferably one that can be slightly heated, such as glass)
2. Place your measured steroid raws into the container.
3. Fill the container with the carrier oil you have decided to use.
4. Add the desired amounts of BA/BB/EO/Guaiacol to the container.
5. Stir the brew until the steroid raws dissolve completely. This may take awhile.
6. If after a sufficient amount of stirring the powder has not dissolved, begin to add heat. If brewing Tren, keep the heat to below 140*F. Others can be heated above that, but you still do not want to cook the oil.
7. If the powder still does not dissolve after some time, you will need to add more solvents.
8. If you heated the brew, let it return to room temperature after the powder has completely dissolved to make sure the hormone will not fall out of suspension.

## Procedure

Note: This procedure was designed for the production of 100-200mL of gear in 10mL vials filled to 10.5mL each

**Before You Begin:**

* Plan your recipe so that your final volume is enough to fill all vials, and allow for 10mL of extra oil to overcome waste during the process
* Put on latex gloves, lab coat, hairnet, and facemask, and wear these at all times, changing gloves whenever necessary
* Assemble all equipment required for the brew (Note: Allow for more vials, stoppers, and flip tops than needed in order to overcome any unforeseen errors during sterilization or capping)
* Place stir bar in the 400mL beaker
* Fill 250mL graduated cylinder with distilled water to your desired final volume
* Pour contents of graduated cylinder into the empty, dry 400mL beaker with the stir bar in it
* Mark the location of the bottom of the meniscus on either side of the beaker, labeling clearly
* Remove stir bar from beaker and pour water out of beaker

**Sterilization:**

* Clean media bottle, beaker, vials, stoppers, flip tops, stir bar, thermometer, and media bottle lid in an Alconox solution, using the brush set
* Rinse with distilled water
* Immerse in hydrogen peroxide for 15 minutes
* Immerse in 70% isopropyl alcohol for 5 minutes
* Rinse with distilled water 3 times
* Place glassware and silicone stoppers (everything except media bottle lid, vial flip tops, stir bar, and thermometer) in foil-lined pan with foil covering (keep sides open) in oven at 350° F for 2 hours
* Leave media bottle lid, vial flip tops, stir bar, and thermometer in alcohol bath until shortly before ready to use, then rinse with distilled water 3 times and dry with Kimwipes
* Turn off oven and leave glassware in oven until ready to use, pulling out each item one at a time, ensuring that each piece is completely dry and free of film or residue

**Brewing:**

* Set up the hotplate stirrer, positioning the thermometer on the stand near the hotplate stirrer
* Place stir bar in the 400mL beaker and place the beaker on the hotplate
* Using a 50mL serological pipette, transfer your desired volume of Benzyl Benzoate to the 400mL beaker (Note: do not blow out the remaining liquid from the pipette once the liquid stops exiting the pipette -- the pipette is designed to expel the correct volume without blowout)
* Using a 10mL serological pipette, transfer your desired volume of Benzyl Alcohol to the 400mL beaker (Note: Again, do not blow out the remaining liquid)
* Turn on the stirring function of the hotplate stirrer and set to a medium speed (Note: Do not turn on the heat function yet)
* Calibrate scale with weight set
* Place an anti-static weigh boat on the scale and tare the scale
* Weigh out your raw compound, transferring the powder to the weigh boat with a small spatula until it meets your desired mass requirement (Note: If you did not use all of your raw compound, remember to tightly re-seal the package in which it will be stored)
* Repeat this process if you are using multiple compounds
* Slowly and carefully empty the contents of the weigh boat(s) into the solution in the beaker as it stirs, allowing the powder to begin to dissolve (Note: Take your time and attempt to let each portion of powder dissolve before adding more -- if the powder will not dissolve, add small portions of carrier oil to the beaker until the fluid level is close to, but not at, the mark you made on the side of the beaker; if it still won't dissolve, turn on the heat function of the hotplate stirrer and allow the solution to heat to a maximum of 50° C, using the mounted thermometer to monitor the temperature)
* Once the powder has dissolved in solution and the fluid level is close to the mark you made on the side of the beaker, continue to allow the solution to stir for a minimum of 30 minutes
* Turn off the stirring function of the hotplate stirrer (Note: If you used heat, turn off the heating function of the hotplate stirrer, as well, and allow the solution to cool to room temperature before continuing)
* Using a 50mL serological pipette, carefully fill the beaker to your volume mark with carrier oil, until the bottom of the meniscus touches the mark you made (Note: If you used the the thermometer, ensure that it is lifted out of the steroid solution before you perform this step -- also, pipette the first bit of oil so that it drips down the end of the thermometer and into the beaker, thus rinsing off any concentrated steroid solution that might have remained on the thermometer)
* Turn the stirring function of the hotplate stirrer back on at a medium speed, and allow the solution to stir for an additional 30 minutes, to ensure that the solution is thoroughly mixed
* Turn off the stirring function of the hotplate stirrer and remove the stir bar from the beaker

**Filtering:**

* Assemble your bottle top filter by screwing the filter top onto the 250mL glass media bottle and connecting the hose from the vacuum pump to the filter
* Open the lid of the bottle top filter and pour the steroid mixture into the reservoir
* Pump the vacuum pump to a pressure of 15 PSI
* Allow the solution to filter until the entire solution is contained within the media bottle
* Remove the filter top from the glass media bottle and screw the lid onto the mouth of the bottle

**Transferring to Vials & Capping:**

* Attach a new sterile 50mL serological pipette to the pipette controller
* Open the lid of the media bottle and extract 42mL of the steroid solution from the bottle, then close the lid immediately
* Expel 10.5mL of the filtered steroid solution from the pipette into a clean, dry, sterile 10mL vial
* Immediately place a silicone stopper on the vial and press down until it is firmly seated
* Repeat the process for 3 more vials
* Repeat the previous 5 steps until you have dispensed all of the steroid solution from the media bottle, and all vials are filled and closed (Note: the last vial may contain a lower amount of the filtered steroid solution, which can be considered "extra")
* Place a flip top cap on a vial and crimp, making sure the lid is crimped on straight
* Repeat this process until all vials are crimped and sealed
* Label the vials

**Clean-Up**

* Dispose of all disposable equipment
* Use the previously prepared wash solutions to wash the glassware, using the aforementioned method
* Store items for next time :)

## Filtering

Filtration is the removal of all microorganisms and particles from liquids without any influence of their ingredients, due to adsorption or decomposition. There are several methods to achieve this, the 2 most popular being Bottle Top Filters and Syringe Filters. Bottle Top Filters are recommended for high quantity brewing (100ml+).

####**Filter Types**

**Cellulose acetate (CA)** membranes have a very low binding affinity for most macromolecules
and are especially recommended for applications requiring low protein binding, such as
filtering culture media containing sera. However, both cellulose acetate and cellulose nitrate
membranes are naturally hydrophobic and have small amounts (less than 1%) of non-toxic
wetting agents added during manufacture to ensure proper wetting of the membrane. If
desired, these agents can be easily removed prior to use by filtering a small amount of warm
purified water through the membrane or filter unit. Surfactant-free cellulose acetate membranes
with very low levels of extractables are available on some Corning®
 syringe filters.

**Cellulose nitrate (CN)** membranes are recommended for filtering solutions where protein
binding is not a concern. They are recommended for use in general laboratory applications
such as buffer filtration. Corning’s cellulose nitrate membranes are Triton®
 X-100-free and
noncytotoxic.

**Nylon membranes** are naturally hydrophilic and are recommended for applications requiring
very low extractables since they do not contain any wetting agents, detergents or surfactants.
Their greater chemical resistance makes them better for filtering more aggressive solutions,
such as alcohols and DMSO. However, like cellulose nitrate membranes, they may bind
greater amounts of proteins and other macromolecules than do the cellulose acetate or
PES membranes. They are recommended for filtering protein-free culture media.

**Polyethersulfone (PES)** membranes are highly recommended for filtering cell culture media.
PES has both very low protein binding and extractables. PES also demonstrates faster flow
rates than cellulosic or nylon membranes.

**Regenerated cellulose (RC)** membranes are hydrophilic and have very good chemical
resistance to solvents, including DMSO. They are used to ultraclean and de-gas solvents and
mobile phases used in HPLC applications.

**Polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE)** membranes are naturally and permanently hydrophobic.
They are ideal for filtering gases, including humidified air. The extreme chemical resistance of
PTFE membranes makes them very useful for filtering solvents or other aggressive chemicals
for which other membranes are unsuitable. Because of their hydrophobicity, PTFE
membranes must be prewetted with a solvent, such as ethanol, before aqueous solutions can
be filtered.

**Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF)** membranes are commonly used in a variety of general filtration and sample preparation applications. It has ultra low binding properties, broad chemical and temperature resistance, and high flow rates. Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic options are available.

**Glass fiber** filters are used as a depth filter for prefiltration of solutions. They have very high
particle loading capacity and are ideal for prefiltering dirty solutions and difficult-to-filter
biological fluids, such as sera.

####**Which Filter Type Should I Use?**

For sterile filtering of oils use PVDF, Nylon, Cellulose Acetate, Cellulose Nitrate, Regenerated Cellulose, or MCE (Mixed Cellulose Esters).

Of the list, I recommend PVDF (It's very commonly found.)

PVDF will have greater filtering capacity. PES can dissolve under high concentrations of BA or BB. 

####**Syringe Filtering**

Syringe Filters are luer lock or luer slip compatible filters that connect directly to a syringe. They are available in a multitude of pore sizes, for our purposes we need .2 or .22 micron. Anything larger and microorganisms will be able to pass, and sterility will not be achieved. You would draw directly from your brew, connect the filter and a 20-23g needle to your syringe, and inject into a sterile vial (one you have sterilized, or have bought pre-sterilized). If you use larger than a 20g needle, you risk cleaving the stopper into the vial and you'll have pieces of your stopper floating around in your vial.

> Also just a quick note that if people are willing to switch out syringe filters every 40ml the oil will flow way better. I find the whole hand cramping thing is very overrated unless I push 60ml+ through the same filter.

*u/3b8bcc64*

> for small batches use 3-5mL syringes, the bigger ones get MUCH harder due to the wall to bottom ratio being too high...pressure goes exponentially more to walls instead of the bottom
95% of guys here give up on syringe filtering because they don't know this

*u/Shotmaniac*

####**Bottle Top Filtering**

Bottle-top filters are used in research laboratories for sterilization or laboratory fluid clarification. The asymmetrical hydrophilic membrane styles provide high flow rates. They are available in a multitude of pore sizes, for our purposes we will need .2 or .22 micron. They are available for purchase of just the filter, or a complete set with a plastic media bottle. A vacuum pump is required when using a bottle top filter, as the filter is activated by vacuum pressure.

A warning when using a bottle top filter - the plastic media bottle you can purchase with them tends to break under moderate vacuum pressure (10+psi). I recommend getting a glass media bottle, most filters will be a GL45 thread. Be sure to match your media bottle thread with your filter thread. You will need to sterilize your glass media bottle before each brew, where-as with the plastic one they send is already sterile.

You will need a [12V adapter](https://www.amazon.com/FAVOLCANO-Switching-Power-Supply-Adapter/dp/B00YGCFXDC/ref=sr_1_24?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1506687463&sr=1-24&keywords=110v+to+12v+dc+power+supply) and to run wires from the adapter to the pump.

## Vials

There is a lot of debate whether one should buy open vials and crimp them yourselves, or if you should buy pre-sterilized vials.

If using the syringe filter method, I recommend buying pre-sterilized vials. You will not be brewing large amounts if you opted for the syringe filters (if you are, good luck), so the extra spent on pre-sterilized vials will be worth it.

If using the Bottle-Top method, there is a sufficient cost savings in buying open vials, along with rubber seals and caps. You will need to buy a vial crimper for this, but there are kits that come with 100 vials, seals and caps for around $90. There is more risk to the sterility of the brew with this method, but if you follow all procedures correctly it is a non-issue. There is simply more room for user error.

Another option for storage is to keep your filtered brew in the media bottle you filtered into, and seal it with a septa cap. Using this method you can draw directly from the media bottle as you would a vial. This eliminates a transfer from the media bottle to another form of storage.

####**Mixing The Powder**

Things you'll need: Milligram scale, small scoop, mortar & pestle, math.

1. Fill one capsule with your active ingredient. weigh on the milligram scale. record weight.
2. Fill one capsule with your filler. weigh on the milligram scale. record weight.
3. Find your ratio of active ingredient/filler (asin/creatine) using the formula -(Desired active dose x total filler)/total active-. This will give you how much space your active ingredient takes up out of a full capsule of your filler. I will use aromasin and creatine as an example. (THESE ARE EXAMPLE CAPACITIES, WEIGH YOUR OWN) One size 1 capsule holds 300mg asin, and 340mg creatine. To find out how much creatine to take out to account for 12.5mg of asin you follow the formula. (12.5 x 340)/300 = 14.166. 12.5mg of aromasin takes up the same amount of space as 14.166mg of creatine. You will be filling one capsule with 12.5mg asin, 325.8mg creatine. Multiply to meet your capsule requirements. So for 100 caps you would need 1.25g asin, 32.58g creatine.
4. Place your active ingredient in the mortar and pestle. 1.25g of aromasin. (This is where we use geometric dilution to achieve a thorough blend.)
5. Weigh out 1.25g of creatine, place in the mortar, and mix.
6. Weigh out 2.5g of creatine, place in mortar, and mix.
7. Weigh out 5g of creatine, place in mortar, and mix.
8. Repeat until desired quantity of powder is achieved.
9. Begin capping process with your newly mixed powder.
