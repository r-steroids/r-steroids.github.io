# Health Markers

## Individual Heath Markers Defined

### Alanine amino-transferase (ALT)

An enzyme produced primarily in the liver but also in other tissues. ALT is involved in amino acid and protein metabolism. Used as a primary marker of hepatic strain. Also called Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase (SGPT). [Commonly elevated in athletes, especially those that specialize in resistance training](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2291230/). 

### Albumin 

The main protein that circulates in the blood. Produced in the liver and has antioxidant properties. Transports certain hormones, vitamins, and minerals, and plays a role in water balance. Used as an indicator of liver health. Higher levels are optimal.

### Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)

A family of cholestatic enzymes produced mainly in the liver, but also in the intestines, kidneys, and bone. Used as a marker of hepatic strain, often relating to disease of the bile ducts.

### Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I)

A constituent of HDL (good) cholesterol, apoA-I is responsible for initiating beneficial reverse cholesterol transport. This process pulls cholesterol particles from the artery walls and transport them back to the liver. Higher levels are optimal.

### Apolipoprotein B (apoB)

A constituent of LDL (bad) cholesterol, apoB is responsible for attaching these lipoproteins to artery walls. ApoB is a promoter of fatty plaque deposits in the arteries. Lower levels are optimal.

### Aspartate amino-transferase (AST)

An enzyme produced primarily in the liver but also in muscle tissue. AST is involved in amino acid and protein metabolism. Used as a marker of hepatic strain, although it is considered less specific than ALT testing. Also called Serum Glutamic-Oxalocetic Transaminase (SGOT). [Commonly elevated in athletes, especially those that specialize in resistance training](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2291230/).
