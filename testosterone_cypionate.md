Testosterone Cypionate is a synthetic version of the naturally produced testosterone hormone. This hormone is responsible for many different physical and mental characteristics in males. It promotes sex drive, fat loss, helps with gaining and maintaining lean muscle mass, increases bone density, and may even protect against heart disease. Whether it is naturally produced or through the use of Testosterone Cypionate, these traits do not change. All other steroids are actually the testosterone molecule that has been altered to change the properties of the hormone.  Testosterone Cypionate carries a rating of 100 when measuring its anabolic/androgenic structure and this rating is used to measure all other steroids. This would make testosterone the "father" of all anabolic steroids used by athletes today.  It should be noted; all testosterone compounds, including Testosterone Cypionate carry this anabolic/androgenic score of 100, as they are all merely testosterone.

Testosterone Cypionate is a highly anabolic and androgenic hormone making it a great steroid to use if one is in pursuit of more size and strength. Testosterone Cypionate promotes nitrogen retention in the muscle and the more nitrogen the muscles hold the more protein the muscles store. Testosterone Cypionate can also increase the levels of another anabolic hormone, IGF-1 in muscle tissue providing even more anabolic activity. Testosterone Cypionate also has the amazing ability to increase the activity of satellite cells. These cells play an active role in repairing damaged muscle. Testosterone also binds to the androgen receptor to promote androgen receptor dependent mechanisms for muscle gain and fat loss.

Testosterone Cypionate induces changes in shape, size and can also change the appearance and the number of muscle fibers. Androgens like testosterone can protect your hard earned muscle from the catabolic (muscle wasting) glucocorticoid hormones, in-turn inhibiting the related adverse reactions. In addition, Testosterone Cypionate has the ability to increase red blood cell production and a higher red blood cell count will improve endurance through increased oxygenation in the blood. More red blood cells can also improve recovery from strenuous physical activity. Even so, Testosterones anabolic/androgenic effects are dose dependent; the higher the dose the higher the muscle building effect.

Many athletes display massive strength gains while using Testosterone Cypionate as the hormone improves muscle contraction by increasing the number of motor neutrons in muscle and improves neuromuscular transmission. It also promotes glycogen synthesis providing more fuel for intense workouts thereby increasing endurance and strength.

Testosterone Cypionate also has the ability to promote fat loss through an enhancement of metabolic activity. Testosterone binds to the androgen receptor fairly well resulting in fat breakdown, and further prevents new fat cell formation. Another indirect action of fat loss that testosterone produces is the nutrient portioning effect it has on muscle and fat. Since the body is building muscle at an accelerated rate more of the food you eat is shuttled to muscle tissue instead of being stored as fat; nutrient efficiency is enhanced.

Testosterone Cypionate will also play a crucial role revolving around creatine. Creatine is essential to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the source of energy for our muscles and when the muscles are stimulated ATP is broken down into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and this is what releases energy. Unfortunately, the process is often too slow during strenuous activity but through the use of Testosterone Cypionate, this demand is met as ATP is replenished at a much faster rate.

## Effects of Testosterone Cypionate

With a well-planned Testosterone Cypionate cycle, nearly every anabolic steroid benefit can be obtained. For the off-season athlete, more lean muscle mass can be built with less body fat gain. In-order to grow, you must consume enough calories and fat gain will occur, but Testosterone Cypionate will ensure the brunt of your weight gain is the weight you want.

While off-season bulking use is the most common, the effects of Testosterone Cypionate can be tremendously beneficial during the cutting phase too. During this period of use, we are able to preserve far more lean muscle tissue that would otherwise be lost. In-order to lose body fat, we must burn more calories than we consume and this can and often does lead to muscle and strength loss. Further, the longer and harder you diet the more muscle and strength will be at risk, but due to the traits of Testosterone Cypionate muscle tissue and strength are protected.

Regardless of the purpose of use, Testosterone Cypionate defines performance enhancement by its ability to promote recovery and endurance. With a performance level dose of Testosterone Cypionate your body can recover faster and you wont tire out as quickly.  This will allow you to workout longer and harder, and more progress can be made. This is performance enhancement at its best!

## Testosterone Cypionate Administration

Testosterone Cypionate is only available in an injectable form and is regularly used to treat conditions such as low testosterone. More than twenty million men in the U.S. alone suffer from some form of low testosterone, and such a condition can severely diminish ones quality of life. Symptoms such as loss of muscle mass and strength, a decrease in libido and sexual performance, an increase in body fat, and low energy levels are all common characteristics of low testosterone. Further, when ignored low testosterone can be a gateway to Alzheimers, diabetes, osteoporosis and many other serious conditions. Most men will find one injection every seven to ten days at 100mg to 200mg per injection to completely eradicate such a problem.

For performance enhancement, one injection per week is often enough; however, in many cases two smaller yet equal sized injections will prove to be far more efficient. The reason for multiple injections is to keep blood levels peaked; further, it is often needed to control side effects that may occur with performance level dosing. Like most anabolic steroids, the more you take the greater the reward, but the more you take the greater the risk. By splitting the injections up into smaller more frequent injections, you are introducing smaller amounts of the hormone for your body to deal with all at once. As for the actual performance doses, this can range anywhere from 200mg per week all the way to 1,000mg per week depending on needs and desires.

The typical dose for those who are using Cypionate to counteract the lowering of testosterone due to the use of other steroids is normally 200mg. If it is being used for direct performance purposes, most will find 400mg to 600mg per week will be effective, but it is important to note that higher doses will greatly increase the risk.

Regardless of the total dose, most steroid users will find this to be an extremely well-tolerated anabolic steroid and one that can be used for long periods of time. 12 weeks of total use is quite commonplace, as is 16 weeks. There's nothing magical about these numbers, but they are solid guidelines in-order for the individual to plan out his desired goals.

Regardless of the total dosing or the cycles length, you will need to design a post cycle therapy (PCT) plan once your Testosterone Cypionate use comes to an end. For most men, if you are discontinuing the use of anabolic steroids for more than ten weeks, you will need PCT but if your off period is less then it can be skipped. For full post cycle information and planning, please see the Post Cycle Therapy page on Steroid.com.

It should be noted; when it comes to performance enhancement, Testosterone Cypionate for women is not recommended. This is a steroid that carries far too much androgenic activity; after all, it is the primary male androgen. Women can suffer from low testosterone and there can be therapeutic benefits from the use of Testosterone Cypionate; however such treatment plans will be tremendously low dosed and should be watched closely for virilization symptoms.

## The Side Effects of Testosterone Cypionate

As an extremely well-tolerated hormone for most men, the side effects of Testosterone Cypionate are in many ways easy to control. When it comes to such adverse reactions, keep in mind they largely fall into the realm of possible and are by no means guaranteed. Even so, total dosing, genetic predispositions and your overall state of health will play a role.

As for the side effects themselves, Testosterone Cypionate like all testosterone compounds carries a high level of aromatase activity; aromatization referring to the conversion of testosterone into estrogen. As estrogen levels rise, this can lead to gynecomastia (male breast enlargement) and excess water retention. This excess water retention can even negatively affect blood pressure. In-order to combat such effects, especially gynecomastia, many turn to Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) such as Tamoxifen Citrate (Nolvadex) and for more serious protection Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs) such as Anastrozole (Arimidex). Without question, AIs are the most effective; however, they can also prove to be problematic when it comes to cholesterol and caution is advised.

Beyond these effects, Testosterone Cypionate can promote dihydrotestosterone (DHT) related side effects such as acne, hair loss and prostate enlargement; however, it should go without saying DHT steroids will be the prime culprits. In-order to provide protection, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as Finasteride can be useful as it is an androgen suppressor and the androgen DHT is causing the problem. It must be noted; hair loss is only possible in men predisposed to male pattern baldness.
