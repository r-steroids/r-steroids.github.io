# The Community

## Community Goals 

The following goals have been adopted by the community.

1. Maintain user safety as a primary concern in all discussions.

2. Facilitate high quality information sharing related to steroids and hormones.

3. Consistently document information related to steroid use for future reference in the /r/steroids/wiki.

4. Let members decide what content is desirable (within the confines of Reddit’s & /r/steroids TOS/rules). 

5. Keep the environment free from any monetary influences.

6. Keep the community tone intact, despite growth and influx of new members.

7. Keep members informed about plans and changes to the community.

## Community Responsibility

Building a great community takes effort from everyone involved.  The moderation team creates the framework in which the members of the community operate, however, we cannot do everything.  Community members have the following responsibilities.

1. Abide by the [community rules of this sub.](/index/subreddit_rules.md#wiki_community_rules)

2. Use the report button and message the moderators for posts that break community rules.

3. Post and promote (up vote) high quality content.

4. Post any lower quality content / questions to these daily [Forum] Ask Anything threads, demote (down vote) topics that are low quality.

5. Use the report button **and** message the moderators for posts that break community rules.

6. Give back to the community, at least, in proportion to what you take from the community.  

7. Help dispel bro-science with real science whenever possible.

8. Have fun, deescalate drama, and make friends.

9. Stay safe.

### What Is Low-Quality Content?

[Under Rule 5 you will find that threads created on /r/steroids must not be Low Quality Content.](/index/subreddit_rules.md#wiki_5._approved_posters_.26amp.3B_high_quality_content_only.)

The following attributes usually describe *low-quality content*.

* Does the topic have a simple answer or is it a yes / no question?

* Does the topic have a greater appeal than to just yourself or a few people?

* Is the topic a "beginner question" and has, more than likely, already been answered in a 2+ year old forum?

* Is the topic in the wiki?

* Is an answer to the topic easily findable by searching /r/steroids?

* Is the topic about your AI, ester, cycle review or similar items that have been covered 1,000 times?

* Are you new to AAS and haven't used our daily Ask Anything thread to ask your first 5-10 questions?  

*The aforementioned likely constitute Low-Quality Content*.

# COMMUNITY RULES

The following rules apply to this community; disregarding them will result in a ban.  All of the standard [rules of Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules) apply here.

# 1. No Personal Information / No Doxxing / No Involuntary Pornography.

**DO NOT POST NUDES OR PERSONAL INFO.**

**OFFERING TO SHARE NUDES OR PERSONAL INFORMATION OF OTHERS IS THE SAME AS SHARING AND WILL RESULT IN A PERMANENT BAN. IN ADDITION, IT WILL BE REPORTED TO REDDIT ADMINS.**

You are free to post your own personal information, however, [you cannot post other people's personal information.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_is_posting_personal_information_ok.3F) In addition to a ban from /r/steroids, it will be reported to Reddit admins and may result in a [shadowban.](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shadowban)

Reddit has updated their Terms of Service. By using Reddit, [you agree to follow their rules whether or not you agree with them,](https://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement/) and as moderators it is our duty to follow their rules as well as ours. Reddit no longer allows users to post Involuntary Pornography.

**Therefore, it is prohibited for users of this subreddit to post any nude or sexual image of any person other than themselves or professional models.** 

# 2. No Source Talk / No Monetization 

The spirit of the Rule is to promote Goal #5 of the community:

*Keep the environment free from any monetary influences.*  

>**Do not ask WHERE** *to get prescription drugs, TRT, HRT, SERMs, SARMS, PEDs and/or AAS.*  
>  
>**Do not ask HOW** *to get prescription drugs, TRT, HRT, SERMs, SARMS, PEDs and/or AAS.*  
>  
>**Do not ask for RECOMMENDED labs, brands or suppliers.**  
>
>**Do not promote BRANDS, COMPANIES, PRODUCTS** *of any sort.*

###**No Source Talk**

***No Source Talk.*** Everything listed below includes (**BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO**): AAS (*gear*), Ancillaries (AI, SERMs, *etc.*), hGH (*those not listed in the Wiki or the rules*), Insulin, DNP, PEDs (*Performance Enhancing Drugs*), Drugs (*prescription or otherwise*), Research Chemicals, Pro-hormones, SARMs, Peptides … or ANY PRODUCT that could be mistaken as legit of any of the previous listed. This includes “steroid alternatives,” “Testosterone Boosters,” or over-the-counter  “PCT” brands.

Chances are … if you are talking about ANY COMPANY, ANY SOURCE, ANY SPECIFIC BRAND, ANY OTHER FORUM. OR SUBREDDIT THAT ALLOWS SOURCE TALK—REGARDLESS OF LEGALITY in your area, this will be considered under NO SOURCE TALK.

### **No Monetization**

***No Monetization***. This part of rule #2 deals with monetary influences such as advertising, sales and marketing, brand discussion, lobbying, promoting coaching services, *etc*. r/steroids, nor its *moderators*, endorse any brands, products, labs, *coaching services*, or any receive any "kick back" from any said service. Others should not be allowed to use this sub for profit either.

**There are no warnings and you will be banned**.

### Why No Sources?

**Reddit's Network Administrators** have shut down other subreddits for allowing source talk. We have a wealth of information compiled in the sub wiki and would prefer to preserve it for harm reduction purposes. 

### Reddit Terms of Service

You indicated consent to the [Reddit Terms of Service (TOS)](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement-october-15-2020) when you signed up for an account. This mandates a number of strict limitations and behavioral guidelines that curtail your activities while using the service. We'd strongly encourage you to familiarize yourself with Reddit's sitewide [Terms Of Service](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement-october-15-2020), the r/steroids [Rules](/index/subreddit_rules.md?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf#wiki_community_rules), the r/steroids [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/jscjwc/steroids_faq/) and the r/steroids [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki). *You'll find the answers to most introductory questions there*, and it can save you a lot of time, trouble, and expense. Familiarize yourself with the material so we don't have to.

Please read over the following carefully and *message the moderators* if you have any questions.

* If steroids, ancillaries, *etc.* are available Over-the-Counter (OTC) in your country; that's fine to talk about, but DO NOT DISCUSS any SPECIFIC pharmacy or source.
* Do **not** PUBLICLY or PRIVATELY: OFFER or ASK for sources/brands/*etc.*, OFFER or ASK to PM source/brands/*etc.*, or OFFER or ASK any of the aforementioned via Private Messaging.
* Do **not** MENTION SOURCES/BRANDS/*etc*. by name, abbreviation, or in any way that makes the source/brand/etc. identifiable to other users
* Do **not** mention sources/brands/*etc*. that are *private* … those that are “not even around anymore” (*i.e* “busted,” “quit,” *etc.*).
* Do **not** hint or make mention of any sources on any other forms of social media.
* Do **not** post pictures with source or brand information visible.
* Do **not** offer to any other user anything that falls under the Preamble, even if you're sending it for free.
* Do **not** mention source aggregators. This includes other sites/subs that allow source talk, or even your personal comment/submissions history.
* Do **not** post ANY brand names, this includes blends (list the compounds that make up the blend instead). For pro-hormones / designer steroids use the "generic" name or Chemical Structure, if necessary (Epistane / 2a,3a-epithio-17a-methyl-5a-androstan-17b-ol, Msten, DMZ, *etc*). It doesn’t matter if they’re legal.
* The **hGH brand names** in our list are one of the *only exceptions* to this. If your brand isn't listed there just refer to it as “*generic hGH*.” The only other exception being **any FDA-approved medication**, **blood work, homebrew, or HPLC testing**. These fall under harm reduction practices.
* Do **not** link or discuss ANY site/sub that allows reviews of products—***legal or illegal***, anything that would fall under the preamble—*legal or not*.
* Do **not** link or discuss ANY site that has sources and/or a product list and/or even discusses sources. This includes things that could be mistaken as legit products.
* Do **not** link or discuss ANY site that has ads for sources. This includes things that could be mistaken as legit products.
* Do **not** link or discuss “*research sites*.”
* Do **not** link or discuss ANY kind of media personalities (*i.e.* ***YouTube***, *etc*.) who sell, recommend, or promote any products—*legal or not*.
* Do **not** have a username that is similar to a source, source talk, a product, or indicates that you are a source. Also a reminder to not have a discriminatory, insulting, offensive or disparaging user name that would be forbidden in Rule 4 or under the **Reddit Terms of Service**.
* Do **not** make comments that could be taken as “fishing” for a source. This includes making posts or comments that mention your inability to find or obtain anything that falls under The Preamble above: “I'm having trouble finding \[good/inexpensive/*etc*.\] Primo” or “It's tough to get Tren,” “My source just stopped carrying,” 
* Do **not** HINT or OFFER to source. Even if you just source to locals, *make no mention* of it.
* Do **not** suggest or refer anyone to ANY doctor or clinic that could potentially help someone obtain a source, even if it's for a legitimate purpose such as TRT.
* **AGAIN**: Do not \[*publicly or privately*\] ASK or OFFER ***To*** PM, ASK or OFFER ***For*** PM, ***or PM*** **ANYTHING** related to sources or source talk.
* Do **not** REPLY to Source Talk, other than to warn the poster of the incoming ban.

**Ask yourself this**:

With one or two mouse clicks and/or Google searches, could someone find a source from this comment, post or question?

* Anything other than an absolute ***NO*** will result in a ban.

###**F.A.Q.**

**Q: Why don't you allow source talk?**

**A**: In addition to the information listed in the wiki, this board is source free so as to remain well clear of any kind of *monetary incentive to manipulate information*. If money can be made by giving out bad information, bad information will follow. Prohibiting source talk also slows down new users and forces more research. We want to make it clear to users that it is not to be taken lightly.

**Q: Why can't we notify members of “bad” sources?**

**A**: Because we cannot verify that the source compounds are bad. Some people may be misusing or mishandling compounds. **Some may be lying to harm a competitor**. Jumping to conclusions should be avoided.

**A**: We would, in all fairness, have to allow the source to defend themselves. This leads to a proliferation of sources in the sub, as well as profiteering, confusion and drama.

**Q: Why can't we post commonly-known brand names?**

**A**: Brand names allow quick access to a Source. We do not differentiate between what is a Pharma brand name and what is a UGL brand name for the same reason. This includes blends (*preworkout or not*), prohormones, and designer steroids. Please use the compound's chemical name, generic name, or chemical structure, if necessary. For example: Tren No Ester, Test No Ester, Epistane, or 2a,3a-epithio-17a-methyl-5a-androstan-17b-ol, Sdrol, Msten, DMZ, Testosterone Undecanoate.

**A**: hGH brand names are one of the ***only exceptions*** to this rule. The ***only other exception*** being any FDA-approved medications such as Sustanon, Viagra or Testoviron Depot. These are considered ubiquitous, and they are approved for discussion because of the strict FDA regulations against advertising that pharmaceutical companies are mandated to follow.

**A**: This leads to shill-type advertising posts, “Is my \[brand\] Tren a good deal at this price? 10mL for $60!” With a quick search on the brand name, one can readily locate the source with the sale, and purchase products from the source.

**A**: For more “conventional” products, **this is not a review board**. It's r/steroids, not some place to discuss the latest sports cars, tennis shoes, weightlifter fashion (r/fitness, r/bodybuilding), paid workout programs such as Meadows, GVT, *etc* (these are also better suited for r/fitness, r/weightlifting, or r/bodybuilding).

**Q: What if the Source, brand, or lab is private, or even no longer around?**

**A**: ***No***. You still may not discuss the source in any way, shape or form.

**Q:  I see that we can't make comments “fishing” for sources. What does that mean?**

**A**: The expression (“**fishing**”) is mostly used by people trying to “fish *for compliments*.” 

“Fishing” for sources is doing things like saying you don't know where to find things in a way that makes it sound as though you are **inviting people** to tell you. This is common with people who are familiar enough with the rules to know they can't outright ask for sources, brands, *etc*. so they try to do it in ways that are more vague.

Some examples of fishing include saying things like: *“I don't even know where to start finding real Testosterone”* or “*I'm having trouble finding* *good Primo”* or “*I really wish I could get* *Dianabol*,” because they hope someone will volunteer the information without having to officially ask the question. We take it seriously when something even *looks like* it could **possibly** be fishing … *even if mildly hinting*.

**Q:** Will the mods help me find a source?  

**A:** Mods will not give out source information.  Do not bother PM'ing. Sending a PM to the Mods or the Modmail to request sources is ***the*** *fastest way to get a ban*.

**Q:** What is the policy for Private Messages / Direct Messages?  

**A:** *See Below* …

###**Moderation of Private Messages**

Simply put, **there is no moderation of PMs.**  

BUT! other users can report you for sourcing and if they do so, you WILL be banned from r/steroids.

Even if a person is banned from r/steroids, they're still able to private message others. There's no way for the r/steroids mods to stop this aside from messaging the Reddit administrators to ban the account. The fastest solution is to block users who you do not want to PM you. If you are feeling harassed, report the user (and any alt accounts) to Reddit admins via [www.reddit.com/report](http://www.reddit.com/report).  

**Q:** When do I PM the Moderators of r/steroids?
  
**A:** If you are receiving unsolicited offers to purchase gear, please report the user to the mods or Modmail with a screenshot, and then to Reddit admins via [www.reddit.com/report](http://www.reddit.com/report).

Reddit does not take lightly to users soliciting in this way. The user will be removed and possibly IP banned. 

Message the mods if you feel harassed or need help or advice about how to proceed.  

If you are private messaged by another user asking for sources or claiming to be a source, please take a screenshot of the PM and use https://imgur.com/ (or any other anonymous photo sharing website of your preference) to send the Moderators and Reddit Admins a screenshot.

## 3. Use Caution / Disclose Guesses / Cite Information

This is a semi-anonymous internet community.  People in discussion in this community are not experts, even if they claim to be experts.  Remain skeptical of claims, protect your identity and freedom and have fun.

####**Use Caution in Understanding**

Members asking for advice should always remain skeptical, research topics, and obtain a thorough understanding before taking any action. The information given by other anonymous community members may, or may not, be accurate.  Protect yourself.

####**Use Caution in PMs**

Community members who post new topics, or even comments, often receive a rash of PM's asking for source information.  The person PM'ing you could be anyone behind the keyboard: just another dude looking to get swole, a person who has determined your identity via your post history, a source, with some monetary incentive to get you to switch or scam you, your mom, my mom, or even an alt of our buddy, /u/DEAtaskforce. Literally anyone.

If you are private messaged by another user asking for sources or claiming to be a source, please take a screenshot of the PM and use https://imgur.com/ (or any other anonymous photo sharing website of your preference) to send the mods the screenshot.

[**PLEASE CLICK HERE TO MESSAGE THE MODERATORS**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsteroids&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=steroids&utm_content=t5_2rifm)

####**Disclose Guesses.**
  
Many of the posts on this community ask for specific details about compound use and technical drug related information.  We would prefer a non-response to an uninformed response.  If you do not feel confident in your understanding of a specific subject, please disclose that it is an educated guess rather than an authoritative answer.  Bad, inaccurate and uninformed advice can lead people to self-injury.  

####**Cite Information; Especially Information That Is Uncommon**

Always cite info when possible, but if you are claiming something that is not common knowledge to /r/steroids, you are **required** to cite the information. If you are debating with someone the only things said with authority are those that are backed by peer-reviewed scientific literature. We will not tolerate people spreading misinformation or citing studies that have little to nothing to do with a user’s claim.

####**No Medical Advice**

***This community does not provide medical, legal or any other types of advice.  We provide only anecdotal experience-based information.  All medical practices should be in consultation with a licensed physician.***

## 4. Keep It Friendly & On-Topic.

This is a mature community with a specific tone and manner that excels compared to most communities. That tone and manner will be maintained. 

####**Be Friendly To Others**

There is no reason to be rude or intentionally inflammatory. If you present yourself as such, your post will be subject to removal and a potential ban may follow. This sub will not put up with you. 

Drama, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, trolling and bullshit will also not be tolerated. It is the right of the community to have fun and evolve inside jokes, lingo, mannerism, and personality will be maintained, however, circle-jerk or off subject posts may be removed.

We are 100% for providing direct and on target information on posted topics or users asking questions. There is a way to do this without asshattery, being offensive, troll posting or getting combative. 

If someone is breaking this portion of Rule 4, do not reply and stoop to their level. It doesn't matter if the other person "started" it, you both will receive a ban. The best thing to do is report this user and ignore them. A mod will see the report and handle it as needed.

**Quite simply, if you cannot respond in a friendly manner seeking to de-escalate conflict, simply do not hit the save button.**

 

####**No Political Discussion**

Political discussion is not permitted. 

Posts and comments that could be construed as highly controversial or provocative are not permitted. First and foremost, the goal of /r/steroids is to provide harm reduction knowledge and guidance without alienating those who need help. As such, we need to maintain a positive, relaxed environment. We're all in the same boat striving for similar goals, try not to rock that boat.

####**No COVID/Vaccine/Mask Discussions**

This falls under the no politics tag unfortunately. There are plenty of places on the internet to discuss this topic, however it seems to veer off topic and get political every time. In an attempt to dispel misinformation on this sub we have decided it is best to leave that topic for more appropriate venues. 

####**No Red Pill or Similar Doctrine**

Discussion of The Red Pill philosophy is also not welcome on this subreddit. There are plenty of places on the internet for this.  

To be clear: this is not the subreddit to share your manifesto or espouse your favorite divisive political, social, religious or philosophical doctrine.

####**No Stirring Shit / Publicizing Bans**

Very simply, do not stir shit. If you have a problem with something, ***message the mods directly. DO NOT POST IT ON THE FORUM.*** 

This is not a forum for you to where your ban like a badge of honor. If you or someone you know is or was banned, make no mention of it. It serves zero purpose other than "what you/they get banned for", which usually branches conversation that leads to more bans on the original user or the people asking.

####**[HARSH] Tag** 

Comments & Post topics that have a [HARSH] tag on them will be moderated less-strictly. This does not mean that we will allow personal attacks, escalated bickering or non-productive comments / criticism. A Comment or Topic with the [HARSH] tag still requires constructive criticism in a comment in order to be productive.

## 5. Approved Posters & High-Quality Content Only. 

After 90 days of participation (comments) in the community, you will automatically be approved to create new topics by /u/steroidsBot. 

If you made a comment in /r/steroids that is at least 90 days old and you weren't automatically approved, [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsteroids) linking to the comment. [More information here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/2t2l76/modharsh_approved_poster_grant_is_increasing_from/)

The only threads that are allowed on /r/steroids are those of high quality content. If you have been around for 90 days you should know that all [Low Quality Content](/index/subreddit_rules.md#wiki_what_is_low_quality_content.3F) belongs in the Daily Ask Anything threads. If you choose to post [Low Quality Content](/index/subreddit_rules.md#wiki_what_is_low_quality_content.3F), your thread will be removed and you risk losing your posting privileges.

If you are ever in doubt if something you want to post is [Low Quality Content](/index/subreddit_rules.md#wiki_what_is_low_quality_content.3F) or not, [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsteroids) and ask for clarification.

####**FAQ**

**Q:** Why can't I create a new topic?  

**A:** To avoid a flood of basic questions, new members cannot create new topics. Commenting on existing topics is allowed and we encourage participation in comments, research, and reading the wiki. You can be approved immediately, by [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsteroids) with your high quality new topic details.

**Q:** When will I be approved?  

**A:** After 90 days of participation in the community.  Functionally, this means that you must have a comment somewhere on a topic in the community for 90 days to be approved.  Please use our daily Ask Anything threads for your questions. You will automatically be approved to create new topics by /u/steroidsBot. If you have a comment in made in /r/steroids that is at least 90 days old and you weren't automatically approved, [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsteroids) linking to the comment.

**Q:** What is considered 'High Quality Content'?  

**A:** Most likely, if the post doesn't fall under [Low Quality Content](/index/subreddit_rules.md#wiki_what_is_low_quality_content.3F), then it is *most likely* 'High Quality Content'. If you are ever in doubt if something you want to post is [Low Quality Content](/index/subreddit_rules.md#wiki_what_is_low_quality_content.3F) or not, [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsteroids) and ask for clarification.

## 6. No Unlawful Discussions.

This community is for harm reduction and educational purposes only. This is not the place to figure out how to break the law. This includes, but not limited to: 

* Discussing the process or how to obtain AAS/drugs/etc

* Discussion of regional legality of AAS 

* Prices of AAS/drugs/etc. (nothing lawful comes of this. We're not here to discuss prices)

* Instruction of obtaining/sending cryptocurrencies (even if it's not for illicit activities)

* Discussing technical means that could be used to circumvent existing legislation, *e.g.* stealth, Mac Address modification, VPNs, DarkNet, Tails, Tor onion routing, encryption, *etc.*  (even if it's not for illicit activities)

* How to place a money order

* Any form of laundering

* Traveling with AAS/prescription drugs/etc.

* How to covertly ship or receive AAS/drugs/etc.

* Any form of smuggling

* *etc. etc.*

**Do not ask or direct others where to go to find any of this type information.**  
If you partake in discussions of any of the aforementioned topics or ways to break laws (even if they don't pertain to your country) you will receive in a ban.  

The only exceptions to this rule is how to purchase needles/syringes, how to obtain blood work, homebrewing, and HPLC testing, as it will fall under harm reduction.

**If you're not sure if something falls under this rule or not, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsteroids) for clarification.**

## 7: Do Your Own Research and Don't be an Askhole.

The purpose of /r/steroids is for *harm reduction*, promoting safer use of anabolic steroids, and sharing information to further those goals. In order to successfully execute on those missions, all users need to develop a fundamental understanding of the compounds we're discussing and how to use them. Additionally, to more effectively and efficiently solicit and receive feedback, its critical for an individual user to share the necessary background information on their situation to help other users accurately assess and answer their questions.

### Do Your Own Research

The /r/steroids wiki and subreddit is a treasure trove of information regarding safer use of AAS. 

Before you ask your question, ensure you've reviewed the following *at minimum*: 

* [The Basics](/thecycle/list.md)
* [Your First Cycle](/your_first_cycle.md)
* [The Estrogen Handbook](/the_estrogen_handbook.md)
* [Post Cycle Therapy aka PCT](/thecycle/pct.md)
* [The Compound Experience Directory](/compound_experience_threads.md)'s threads for the compound you're curious about

Consider also:

* Searching /r/steroids using https://camas.unddit.com/
   * Input `steroids` under `SUBREDDIT` and your key words under `SEARCH TERM`
* Googling your question
    * Also search this subreddit using google by performing the following query: `site:www.reddit.com/r/steroids <Search String>`
* Scrolling through a couple previous Ask Anything threads

### Don't be an Askhole

We're all busy, and everybody here is volunteering their time to help one another achieve our mutual goals. By providing enough background information and making it very clear what you want to know, you enable more experienced users to quickly understand where you're at, where you've been, and where you're trying to go!

*Please understand that a full picture of your situation is required to help you.*

**Things you should include:**

* Your background stats:
    * Height
    * Weight
    * Age or age range
    * Gender
    * Bodyfat percentage
    * Experience level, consider:
        * years of concurrent training
        * bench/squat/dead maxes, PRs, etc
        * amateur/pro  
    * Bloodwork, include:
        * Values
        * Reference ranges
        * Units of measure
* Your goals:
    * Athletic goals, e.g. are you training for aesthetics on a casual or professional level, strength, a specific sport, etc.
    * Are you bulking, cutting, maintaining? ([Don't say recomp](https://www.realstorygroup.com/images/up/Going%20Nowhere%20Fast.jpg), [don't say recomp](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1178700346/vector/businessmen-riding-tandem-bicycle-facing-opposite-directions.jpg?s=170667a&w=0&k=20&c=k6sZxXjQFyLotwUJSosONPRlQVUbKkHE6d3CfhReGJk=), [don't say recomp](https://cdn.road.cc/sites/default/files/styles/main_width/public/images/News/Push%20Me-Pull%20You%20Tandem%20%28Facebook%20video%20still%29.JPG))
* Your intended compounds to use:
    * The full list of compounds including esters (enanthate, propionate, undecanoate etc.) as opposed to just "testo" or "nand"
    * The milligrams or IU you intend to use per day or week, NOT cc's, not mLs
    * Your experience with these compounds

**You should not:**

* Simply ask:
>    * thoughts?
>    * anybody ever used [compound]? 
>       * (see the [Compound Experience Directory](/compound_experience_threads.md))
>    * Which steroid is best for [xyz]?
>    * What steroid does [xyz]?
>    * Which steroid increases [metabolism/fat loss/xyz]?

* Ask what cycle your favorite influencer is on
* Ask if [xyz influencer/athlete/celebrity] is natty or not
* Repeatedly ask the same question day after day
* Continuously ask hypothetical questions without sharing helpful background information as to *why* you're asking these questions

#### In short:

Your question should be **clear**, **concise**, **well-formatted**, and have **all the background information** necessary for an experienced user to read it and quickly help point you in the right direction!

### Questions and Concerns?

Please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsteroids) with any questions, concerns, or clarifications you may have/need.  Topics created with rule or community administration questions will be removed.

#### Voting

In line with goal #4, community members are expected to use their up-vote and down-vote capabilities.  We detest shit-posting; if you don't like a topic, down vote and move leave.  No one cares that you didn't like it, so there is no need to comment on it.  Save us all the time and effort.

#### Report button

When violations of the community rules are noticed, please use the report button.  This helps the moderation team quickly clean things up and severely dis-incentivizes people from attempting to subvert our community rules.

#### Search before posting.

You can use these terms to find historic posts using Google, just like those links do above.

**Please, use this search before posting a new topic!**

Simply replace the <Search String> with a post type or other search criteria and go.

## Warning/Banning System

As a part of our desire for transparency, below is the general system that is followed by moderators of the sub for our most common rule offenses.  *These are guidelines only.*

#### Minor Violation
These violations are small things primarily focused around maintaining the community tone.  General asshattery and trolling inclusive.  Again, *these are guidelines only* and moderator discretion will prevail.

* First/Second Violation: Warnings or 3-14 day ban (at moderator discretion).
* Second/Third Violation: 14-30 or so day ban (at moderator discretion).
* Third/Fourth Violation: Permanent ban.

#### Major Violation
These violations are considered to be very detrimental to the community.  Any form of monetization of the community, source talk, being overtly confrontational, having a "Reddit reputation" for asshattery or trolling and similar.

* First Violation: 14-30 or so day ban (at moderator discretion).
* Second Violation: Permanent ban.

#### Terminal Violation
These violations are considered to be dangerous / threatening to an individual or community member.  They can include harassment, doxxing, and persistent attempts at monetization of the community.

* First Violation: Permanent ban.  Possible report to Reddit Admins.

Bots who do not ask permission to operate in the sub fall into this category.

### Ban Appeals
If you wish to appeal your moderation action, you must [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsteroids).  How does the appellate process work?

1. Interested moderators will read the appeal from the community member.
2. Interested moderators will investigate the merits of the appeal.  
3. If an interested moderator believes your appeal is worthy, they will advocate on your behalf.
4. If the banning moderator finds merit in the appeals and advocacy, s/he can un-ban the community member.

In all but the absolutely most extreme cases the banning moderator's decision is final.
