# Bloodwork

If you're going to use anabolic steroids—or any type of performance enhancing compounds—it's important to run bloodwork at least three to four times per year. It's like getting your pool water checked to make sure there is the right amount of chemicals for it to stay clear and problem free, or checking the air pressure in your car's tires to ensure you don't have a blowout at high speed on the freeway. 

What's more, it would be a good idea to get bloodwork *before* cycling, so you can know where your baseline is and flag any problems ahead of time. For example, you might have elevated liver values from some other medication or health issue. You could have elevated blood glucose levels, indicating you're pre-diabetic. 

It's far better to know these things in advance and get them treated as soon as possible. If you know about any red flags beforehand it will help prevent even bigger issues, such as when you have elevated liver values when running a harsh oral steroid. Or you may have high estrogen going into a cycle, so you may want to reduce your levels, or avoid using excessive aromatizing compounds.

When you use anabolic steroids, the pituitary glands of the HPTA axis react to exogenous hormones by going dormant. As a result, your LH and FSH levels will quickly drop to near zero, and your body will no longer produce Testosterone on its own. 

Further examples of effects on bloodwork include:

* *Testosterone*, *Dianabol*, *Nandrolone* can increase Estrogen (E2) levels.

* *Trenbolone* can quickly strain your lipids and cortisol levels.

* *Equipoise* (EQ, Boldenone) is known to cause elevated RBC (*red blood cell*) counts.

If you want to use AAS safely, bloodwork is essential.  

* A pre-cycle check will warn of any potential reason not to use AAS and give a baseline for comparison later on.

* A mid-cycle check will show things at their worst from a health perspective. 

* A test after completing PCT can ensure things have returned to normal. 

* For those that Blast & Cruise (B&C), it's important to run bloodwork at least 3-4 times per year to ensure health levels are stable and not declining or anomalous for any reason. 

*It's good to have a baseline knowledge* of individual health markers, so be sure to check out our [Health Markers](/bloodwork/health_markers.md) page.

## How Do I Get Bloodwork?

There are two principal ways to get bloodwork done. 

1. The most common is to request bloodwork from your doctor, give him/her a list of things you want to get done, and s/he will send you to the lab. Some hesitate to do this, as they're afraid of potentially being flagged as a steroid or drug abuser, and they don't want it to potentially affect their health insurance or employment options. 

2. A popular second method of getting bloodwork is ordering it online. This way you independently pay for what you want done, and then take the printed request forms to a private lab.

## What Bloodwork do you need before Your First Cycle?

**TLDR:** An easy and popular way to get labs done in the U.S. is to order the ["Hormone Panel with Estradiol Ultrasensitive, Testosterone LC/MS-MS and Lipid" package](https://www.privatemdlabs.com/lab_tests.php#4114) from privatemdlabs.com. This will provide a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count (CBC), hormone panel, and lipid panel. As of January 2023, the cost is $118.99. **Use discount code "WIKI" for 15% off of your total order**. Note that the panel costs substantially more from LabCorp, so be sure to choose the Quest option if you have Quest Diagnostics locations near you. Also note that due to state laws, Private MD Labs can not provide lab orders in the states of New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, or Hawaii.

Continue reading for a more in-depth explanation.

When ordering online, you can usually find a **Standard Male Hormone Panel****.** 

This typically includes: 

**Hormones** — You'll need a baseline for your HPTA axis to know if you're already hypogonadal (*low T levels*), as well as if you've recovered fully after your PCT.

* **LH, FSH:** These gonadotropins stimulate the testes to produce testosterone.

* **Testosterone:** That's what we're all here for, right?

* **SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin):** Acts as a carrier protein by binding testosterone and estrogen in the bloodstream

* **Free Testosterone:** This is the amount of unbound testosterone (not bound to SHBG or albumin) in the bloodstream. This lab is optional, at least for initial lab work. It might be useful for helping to investigate hormone issues that aren't explained by the total testosterone level.

* **Estradiol:** Estradiol is affected by aromatizing hormones. It's good to know if it's high when going in, and when dialing in AI mid-cycle.

**Health markers** — These are standard panels for organ function, electrolytes, blood glucose, cholesterol, and prostate that give a more comprehensive picture of overall health.

* **CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel):** These are basic health markers that provide information about kidney function, liver function, electrolytes, and blood glucose.

* **CBC (Complete Blood Count):** Provides information about red blood cells such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, and cell size, and information about the various leukocytes (white blood cells).

* **Lipids (LDL, HDL, trigylcerides):** AAS tend to decrease HDL and increase LDL, which is not good for cardiovascular health. You'll need a baseline to ensure you're healthy going in.

* **Liver function (AST, ALT, GGT, Bilirubin, Albumin):** These are mainly important if you're planning on orals, or trenbolone, which can be hepatotoxic. You want to be sure your liver is healthy going into the cycle. All of these except sometimes GGT are included in the CMP.

* **PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen):** If this is elevated you could have prostate cancer. If you have prostate cancer and take androgens, it's like throwing gasoline on a fire. Ensure levels are normal prior to starting any AAS.

* **Blood Glucose:** you'll want to ensure you're not pre-diabetic.

Not too complicated, right?

## Where To Get Private bloodwork

There are many services through out the world that provide individuals the capability to get private paid bloodwork. These services are invaluable to AAS users to monitor health and safety.

### In the USA

There are several providers in the USA to choose from.

**Note**: Unfortunately, testing is unavailable in *NY*, *NJ*, *RI* and *HI*. If you're a resident of one of these states you'll have to drive out of state to use Private MD Labs, LabsMD, or any other private lab. Instructions Below.

*MA & MD residents only*: You can use [Health Tests Direct.](https://www.health-tests-direct.com/)

#### Private MD Labs

[Private MD Labs](https://www.privatemdlabs.com/) — A good and trusted online service that can send lab orders to Quest Diagnostics or LabCorp locations. Note that in most cases, LabCorp tests are significantly more expensive than Quest for the same information. It's generally recommended to use Quest if there are locations near you.

Use the code **WIKI** to save 15%

* ["Hormone Panel with Estradiol Ultrasensitive, Testosterone LC/MS-MS and Lipid" package](https://www.privatemdlabs.com/lab_tests.php#4114). This will provide a CMP, CBC, hormone panel, and lipid panel. The testosterone results will show levels greater than 1500 ng/dL, and the estradiol test is the ultrasensitive version. **DO NOT** use this to test whether your tren is counterfeit, as it will not count it in the estrogen test.

* Anything with [Test 070195](http://www.privatemdlabs.com/lab_tests.php?view=search_results&search=070195) will show the actual value for testosterone, rather than “high” or “greater than 1500.” 

* [Thyroid TSH, T4 and T3 Panel](http://www.privatemdlabs.com/lp/Thyroid_TSH_T3_T4.php) optional, check thyroid levels if you suspect anything wrong with them. 

* [Liver Panel](http://www.privatemdlabs.com/lp/liver_panel.php) This test is important if using oral steroids. This is included in the CMP. You do not need to order it separately.

* [Lipid Test](http://www.privatemdlabs.com/lp/lipid_panel.php) to check cholesterol levels.

* Anything with [Test 303756](http://www.privatemdlabs.com/lab_tests.php?view=search_results&search=303756) contains a lipid panel.

#### ULTA Labs

* [ULTA Labs](https://www.ultalabtests.com/ultdirect) offers affordable bloodwork nationwide. Secure and confidential lab testing, most results available in 1-2 business days. Licensed Medical Director in every state that reviews each order.

They email you a requisition form in a few minutes that you can take to a life labs or similar.

#### TeleTest.ca

You can also use [TeleTest](https://teletest.ca/)! /u/miketeletest notes:

> TeleTest has a panel specifically for PED users that checks all the relevant hormones and biomarkers, and includes a followup consultation with our physicians to review results. Our service allows patients to order the panel from their phone and arrange lab work that same day usually which could be a better alternative to walk-in clinics or waiting on family doctors. We want to make the process of getting bloodwork easy so people can utilize AAS as safely as possible.

[**Info Taken From This Post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/6yqkqw/crowdsource_canadian_blood_work/)

**The Following are all anecdotes taken from the thread linked above:**

* In Ontario? Go to an Appletree clinic and say you want bloodwork. That easy. They also run acne clinics and oversee and prescribe Accutane. Dudes take good care of us.

* Worth saying, just go to a walk-in. Say you're on steroids, don't be embarrassed, literally no one cares. Is there a chance you encounter a doctor who says SHAME and refuses to give you healthcare? Sure. Less likely than them just covering their asses and checking your shit. Maybe you won't get uncapped Test levels, but you'll get your lipids and liver enzymes checked.

### New Brunswick

* In New Brunswick. I don't have a family doctor, so I went to a walk in clinic and told the doctor I was planning to go on steroids, and wanted bloodwork done. He filled out a bloodwork order form that I could take to the hospital, or to a walk-in blood clinic. After a couple visits, I asked for the order to be made a recurring one. So now I can just stop in at the walk-in blood clinic (they charge $14 to draw) and they'll use the order they have on file and send it to the hospital lab. Lab results get sent to the doctor that ordered them. I generally don't go to the clinic to review results, I go to the personal health records office at the hospital and request a hard copy of the results. They print it out and hand it over to me.

### British Columbia

* In BC but this should go for anywhere in Canada (Naturopaths cannot order blood tests in New Brunswick). Go to a naturopathic doctor, they can request blood tests. Most benefits packages include visits to naturopaths, so it's in a way almost free.

### Montreal

* I'm in Montreal, and i just went to a doctor, walk-in clinic and asked for blood test, the reason if I remember was test booster, feeling moody. He gave me a paper with the test he wanted checked, i checked the rest, didn't get in trouble.

### Quebec

* In Quebec. I went to my doctor and basically told her I was on and explained why bloodwork was important for me to stay safe. If the doc is reasonable they will hook you up, if the doc is hard-headed (the first doc I tried was like this) then just go to another doc. The thing that sucks is that you can't get bloods as often as you'd like because the doc probably won't think its necessary.

### Ottawa

* I go to a medical clinic in Ottawa (Sandy Hill Clinic) that has large numbers of drug users. Every big town or city has one. Just look up HIV Prevention on your cities web site. There they practice "Harm Reduction" so when you ask a doc for any test in order to reduce harm, they will do it eagerly.

### Alberta

* Honestly I just kept asking ... This is in Alberta btw. Ended up finding someone at a walk in clinic (Calgary) willing to write me up for what I wanted.

* In Alberta i went to a walk in with the whole im tired etc thing to get my first bloods. Eventually i got sick of making excuses so i just told him what im going to be taking and that i wanted regular bloodwork to monitor health. Very understanding no lecture nothing he just said ok whatever you need on the panel let me know and i will give you req sheets for it. When you want more bloodwork just make an appointment. Now i just go to him when i need bloodwork and he's also my family doc now as well.

* I went to a walk-in clinic. Told the doctor I want a sheet for SELF PAID bloodwork. Tell them your interested in having your hormones check because you feel rundown and you just want to see for your piece of mind. Photo copy it and keep re using it. The costs for self paid test vary place to place and Provence to Provence. In BC a testosterone test from a lab cost $80. In Alberta labs charge $45 and the universities charge $22. Shop around and check your local university for pricing . There is single collection fee aswell each time you go, in Alberta it's $25. If the doctor puts their info on the sheet get a new slip from another doctor or they'll keep being sent your bloodwork and your history will show up. If your tight with your doctor they won't mind. Be aware your bloodwork is not private and will be sent to provincial data bases for physicians to access. It may be possible for self paid bloodwork to be request not to appear in databases. However my self Paid blood has.

* AB here. I go to a Naturopath to avoid getting labeled a drug user on my medical file. Work benefits cover 2 blood tests /yr.

* [Related top-level thread on Canadian bloodwork](/r/steroids/comments/30u9oi/bloodwork_results_in_canada_followup_thread/)

**Potential Route**: Go to a walk-in clinic.  When the doc comes in, say you are taking a Test booster, you feel moody, and your nipples are sensitive. S/he will send you for a blood test. Make sure you say your nipples are sensitive or s/he wont check the E2 boxes on the form. These forms are good for a year, so once you have them, just give blood when you want.

## Additional Notes

### If running Trenbolone ...

When running Tren, if you get your Estrogen (E2) levels checked, make sure to get the **LC/MS** sensitive estrogen reading. Why? Most estrogen tests are ECLIA or RIA. These will count tren as estrogen. This will give you a false estrogen reading if you are trying to dial your AI in. The only time you may want the ECLIA or RIA method is when you wish to see if there actually *is* Trenbolone in a vial that you believe to be Trenbolone—but this shouldn't be necessary, right? You wouldn't work with a source you don't trust, would you?

Tren has negative impact on the following that you should check if running it: Liver Function Tests (LFTs); fractionated cholesterol (HDL/LDL), AST/ALT/GGT/Bilrubin (liver hormones that show how well things are functioning).

**Haematology:** Measures haemoglobin, red blood cell numbers and size, as well as distribution of white blood cell types.

**Electrolytes and LFT's:** gives information on liver and kidney function.

**Fractionated cholesterol:**  HDL/LDL ratio and triglycerides.

**Iron studies:**  Total serum iron, transferrin levels (the carrier protein) and ferritin  (the tissue storage protein).

**Thyroid Function Tests:** T3, T4, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) will tell you if there are any problems with your thyroid.

**Cortisol**: If your stress hormones are elevated it could point to other as-yet undiagnosed preexisting disorders or conditions. Tren has a tendency to elevate cortisol levels.

**hGH, IGF-I:** Only necessary if using hGH or hGH releasing peptides to measure effectiveness.  A *moderate* rise will be seen with AAS use alone.

hGH stands for human Growth Hormone, a 171 amino acid polypeptide hormone released from the Anterior Pituitary gland in the brain.  Its release is controlled by at least two hormones from the Hypothalamus...GH Releasing Factor and Somatostatin.  GHRF stimulates GH in a pulsitile manner, while Somatostatin inhibits it's release.  IGF-I, which is released from the liver into the circulation in response to GH release, is also thought to inhibit GH release in a negative feedback loop.

IGF-I is thought to mediate many of the effects of hGH. In response to hGH, muscle and many other tissues, can make their own IGF-I inside the cells.  The resultant IGF-I synthesis effects both neighboring cells, and the cell itself via the Akt pathway (autocrine/paracrine secretion).  Some of those neighboring cells in muscle are satellite cells, which are stem cells present inside the muscle sarcolemma, but outside of the actual muscle cells.  IGF-I has the effect of increasing their number, and to differentiate (change them) into muscle cells. The satellite cell changes into a myoblast (primitive muscle cell) which then fuses into an existing fibre (particularly an inured one) and donates its nucleus.

When a muscle has to grow or repair, it requires more DNA which is donated by the satellite cells.  This is to keep the protein/DNA ratio constant as a cell grows.  Skeletal muscle is unusual in that it is a multi-nucleated cell.  This is thought necessary as skeletal muscle cells are so relatively large that one nucleus could not adequately serve the whole cell.

The effects of IGF-I administration for bodybuilding purposes are controversial in terms of efficacy of low (microgram) dosages.  In clinical trials it has been used in the range of 8-10 milligrams per day.  There seems to be a great disparity here between anecdotal reports and published studies.

## Blood Values Sorted By Mass and Molar Concentration

## Research topics (to be moved)

**GHRP's**: GHRP's are peptide hormones (short chain of amino acids) that stimulate either directly or indirectly hGH release in humans.  GRP6 or GHRP2 are relatively short acting, while CJC1295 is longer acting.  GHRP6 stimulates Gherelin release, resulting in hunger.  GHRP2 does not have the same effect on Gherelin, but like GHRP6, it elevates cortisol.  Ipamorelin stimulates GH release without the increases in Gherelin and cortisol seen with the others.

**Myostatin Inhibitors**: Myostatin is a protein hormone that stops muscle growing too big.  It is thought that most organs, including skeltal muscle, have a specific growth regulating protein.  In Skeletal muscle, that is myostatin or GDF8, Growth and Development Factor 8. So if myostatin stops muscles from growing too big, why not suppress or inhibit it?  There is much research to try and accomplish this in humans without side effects.

There are three viable methods for myostatin inhibition. 

* First, there is the antibody approach.  This entails injecting a monoclonal (*very specific*) antibody into a subject, which will bind to, and tie up circulating myostatin levels. See MYO-029: [Stamulumab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamulumab)).

* Second, there is the “small molecule approach” that use inhibitors of the myostain receptor, such as SB 431 542 and GW 788 388.  These receptor inhibitors act in a similar manner to Nolvadex as a blocker of the estrogen receptor.  It won't reduce the amount of myostatin, but it will block its effects at the receptor level.

* Third, there is the use of a soluble portion of the receptor (ActIIb receptor), which mops up myostatin in the blood and acts essentially as a binding protein for myostatin. Analogous to SHBG, which we are all familiar with, which mops up (binds) testosterone and its analogues in the blood. ActIIb receptor binds too and deactivates myostatin.   The Activin receptor and the Myostatin receptor are essentially the same thing.
