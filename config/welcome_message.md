Welcome to r/steroids!

* Please be sure to review our rules; https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/index/subreddit_rules/

* Please read the subs Wiki for beginner cycle and comprehensive compound information; https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/

We reserve new threads for quality posts that benefit the community as a whole. Think **Headline News**.

Aside from that we have a daily posted *Ask Anything* thread for AAS related questions, and *Off Topic* for general bullshit. We also have weekly nutrition, training, bloodwork, and monthly progress threads (a posting schedule is available on the subs sidebar).

The idea is that 90 days after participating in the comments you understand how the community works and are then approved to the sub (automatically) and can make a post, *with the understanding that it must be high quality and if it isn’t your “approved poster” status will be revoked.*

So feel free to participate in the comments until then
