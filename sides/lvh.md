Taken from: http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/1ggw9a/aas_use_and_hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy/

Over some more recent reading (was curious after I just learned about cardio in one of my classes), I read up a little bit on cardiac hypertrophy and AAS use.

So there are actually different types of heart enlargement. They can be physiological (normal) or pathological (bad). [Athlete's heart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlete%27s_heart) is a type of hypertrophy that's physiological in response to exercise (a lot of elite endurance and resistance athletes end up with athlete's heart) and your heart actually gets *stronger* as a result of it (it can pump blood more efficiently).

Hyertrophic cardiomyopathy is another one where your ventricles get more muscular, without your heart necessarily getting stronger or pumping out blood more efficiently. This can be bad, and is one of the most common causes of [sudden cardiac death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_cardiac_death) in athletes. It's important to note: most of these people were *born* with the potential for this happen. But this is what you hear about when you see a 19 year old football player dropping dead of a heart attack.

----------------

So here's the thing: AAS use/abuse long term can *precipitate* left ventricular hypertrophy that has the potential to be pathological. You can have athlete's heart *and* hypertrophic cardiomyopathy too. Generally it's not going to fuck your shit up, but it *might* be potentially dangerous in the very long term.

[See here](http://journals.lww.com/cjsportsmed/Abstract/1997/04000/Left_Ventricular_Size_and_Function_in_Elite.3.aspx):

> The smaller LVDEd in DUs is coupled with a significantly disproportionate septal and posterior wall thickness in DUs when indexed to body mass compared to DFs. There was no direct evidence of diastolic dysfunction detected by mitral inflow velocity patterns.

So no abnormalities other than hypertrophy itself.

If you have a pre-existing condition (ie: zyzz), then it could be *potentially* bad. There's lots of n=1 studies on the subject, but fuck n=1 studies for the most part.

[Working out on it's own seems to have a protective effect](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002914901015855)

-------------------------

The thing is though, even after cessation of AAS for 1+ years, cardiac hypertrophy doesn't full attenuate itself. [This trial](http://heart.bmj.com/content/90/5/496.short) compared resistance athletes, former AAS users, and current AAS users.

> Systolic blood pressure was higher in users (mean (SD) 140 (10) mm Hg) than in ex-users (130 (5) mm Hg) (p < 0.05) or weightlifters (125 (10) mm Hg; p < 0.001). Left ventricular muscle mass related to fat-free body mass and the ratio of mean left ventricular wall thickness to internal diameter were not significantly higher in users (3.32 (0.48) g/kg and 42.1 (4.4)%) than in ex-users (3.16 (0.53) g/kg and 40.3 (3.8)%), but were lower in weightlifters (2.43 (0.26) g/kg and 36.5 (4.0)%; p < 0.001).

> The maximum late transmitral Doppler flow velocity (Amax) was higher in users (61 (12) cm/s) and ex-users (60 (12) cm/s) than in weightlifters (50 (9) cm/s; p < 0.05 and p  =  0.054). 

Doppler testing is used to test heart function (and to differentiate between athlete's heart and myopathy in athletes). So there is a bit of a discrepancy. 

Important to keep in mind: a lot of the current users might have been absolutely *swimming* in AAS and a variety of compounds (elite bodybuilders), so the results might not carry over to your average dude just taking a 500mg/week cycle of Test E, or 125mg/week for TRT.

--------------------------------

BUT: in animal studies it's been shown that the T:E ratio might have an influence on cardiac hypertrophy in animal models (women are also much less likely to have hypertrophy), and there ERB is expressed in the heart and in normal amounts has an anti-hypertrophy effect on heart muscle.

[From this](http://ajpheart.physiology.org/content/288/2/H469.short):

> These data suggest an important role for estrogen receptor-β in attenuating the hypertrophic response to pressure overload in females. (**mice**)

In [susceptible humans](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022282808004537), there appears to be polymorphisms in the aromatase enzyme, and it seems to be pretty common in people with cardiomyopathy.

----------------------

There might also be a role of Vitamin D deficiency in the development of cardiac hypertrophy.

[This trial](http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/52/6/1106.short) shows an increased expression of VDR in cardiac hypertrophy, and Vitamin D is thought to have an antihypertrophic effect in heart ventricles. There is some evidence that it might increase conversion of Testosterone to Estradiol in certain tissues (via acting on the aromatase enzyme), like the bones and in the balls (promoting spermiogenesis and bone formation). There's also a trial I remember reading showing improved cytokine profiles in congestive heart failure, which is only tangentially related.

Edit: [here's another trial](http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/88295) that showed people on dialysis (who suffered from several Vitamin deficiencies, including Vitamin D) had a reduction in their cardiomyopathy after being given fully active Vitamin D (calcitriol). Now it's not known how much can be extrapolated from this to healthy people (or AAS users), but the mechanism definitely seems to be there.

------------------------------------------------------

Then there's Coenzyme Q10 which has repeatedly been shown to be good for blood vessel and heart health (among other things). In cardiomyopathy there might actually be a deficiency of CoQ10 [as is shown in this article](http://www.pnas.org/content/82/3/901.short).

[This six year clinical trial showed improvements in cardiomyopathy with supplementation of 100mg/day](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2276895)

[This trial showed improvements with 200mg/day](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829979700006X) and even showed a reduce in septal thickness:

> The mean interventricular septal thickness improved significantly from 1.51±0.17 cm to 1.14±0.13 cm, a 24% reduction (P < 0.002). The mean posterior wall thickness improved significantly from 1.37±0.13 cm to 1.01±0.15 cm, a 26% reduction (P<0.005). Mitral valve inflow slope by pulsed wave Doppler (EF slope) showed a non-significant trend towards improvement, 1.55±0.49 m/sec2 to 2.58±1.18 m/sec2 (P<0.08). 

(13-15mm is the "danger zone" and 15mm+ = pathology)

So what the hell's the point of all this? Should you stop taking AAS? If you have a heart defect, probably, or you should *definitely* run it by your doc. But for the average user, what should you do? Well, maybe some prophylaxis might not be a bad idea.

You can buy some Vitamin D and Coenzyme Q10 (you should probably be taking Vitamin D already, especially if you're running any sort of AI) and take it every morning.

Disclaimer: I stand to make a whole $0.40 per purchase or something like that  
If you find it cheaper (maybe through amazon prime or on smartpowders?) then go with that, obviously.
