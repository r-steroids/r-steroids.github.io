First off, before I start. I want to credit /u/flushbrah for originally posting the idea: http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/1is6hj/counteracting_the_cardio_impact_of_tren_ace/

Anyone who has taken tren before knows that it fucks with your cardiovascular system.

Inject or nick a vein? Hope you enjoy dying for the next couple of minutes.

Distance running? Forget it.

Sprints? You're a funny guy.

Sex? Fuck it, I'm on bottom.

Now what if I told you, the reason tren does this, is because tren triggers an asthma like response in the body?

**What the fuck OTTO, you're crazy! Tren doesn't cause asthma.**

There are two main theories behind tren's cardio issues.

1. Pulmonary oil microembolism, where some oil is making it's way to the lungs. This possibly answers for the "tren cough" when you inject or nick a vein.

2. Leukotrienes are a major contributing factor of asthma. Tren causes rises in prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are still sort of a mystery in terms of formation and role in the human body. They are made by two different pathways, cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase. Cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, compete to form prostaglandins; as well as thromboxanes, AKA leukotriene. Thromboxanes cause constriction of vascular smooth muscle and platelet aggregation. Leukotrienes are made in leukocytes and macrophages via the lipoxygenase pathway. They are potent constrictors of the bronchial airways. They are also important in inflammation and hypersensitivity reaction. Because tren increases production of prostaglandins, the corresponding rise in leukotrienes causes inflammation in the lungs. This is why tren causes cardio effects such as wheezing, shortness of breath, and the in-famous "tren cough". This is the actual reason (at least from what my experiment has shown).

From /u/stolenlunches:

> Looking into this, I see all over the place this discussion about prostaglandins/thromboxanes and the cyclooxygenase pathway and the suggestion is that prostaglandins are synthesized either by the cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase pathway and somehow increase leukotriene synthesis, but that is not correct. They are both different pathways responsible for different synthesis and only leukotrienes are mediated by the lipoxygenase pathway which makes the discussion of prostaglandin strange and irrelevant. Maybe it is just a mistake someone made a long time ago that has been perpetuated since.
> 
> My guess would be something more along the lines of an increase in phospholipids, thereby increasing the availability of arachidonic acid which increases the production of all of the eicosanoids (prostaglandin, thomboxane, leukotriene), but that the detrimental effects of trenbolone on cardio performance are seen in the effect of increased leukotriene synthesis and the discussion of other eicosanoids is just noise that complicates the issue.

Another possible theory:

> It might be related to the accelerated burning of fat due to tren. Arachidonic acid is freed from the phospholipid by phospholipase A2, an enzyme that releases fatty acids from glycerol. Glycerol is the precursor the the synthesis of triacylglycerols, phospholipids in the liver and adipose tissue. Since tren limits de novo lipogenesis, the glycerol never becomes adipose tissue. This means you have glycerol being broken down, releasing more of the phospholipase A2 enzyme. Of course the gycerol not turned adipose could very well be used to increase phospholipids as well, which would support the above theory by /u/stolenlunches

**Why use yourself as a human guinea pig?**

I originally began looking into this because I'm primarily a powerlifter, but also participate in dragon boat and enjoy dabbling in gymnastics. I've found that a leukotriene modifier, like Singulair (Montelukast), a common allergy medication, blocks leukotriene receptors in your lungs. After researching different interactions and sides for it, I deemed it safe and ordered a couple packs of it.

**How did you do the experiment?**

My initial testing method was I would do 3x 300m sprints using a Concept 2 rower/ERG twice a week. I would then average my times and use that as the score for the day, coming out with two scores per week. Here are the numbers:

Week before injections:

* D1 - 41 seconds
* D2 - 42 seconds

350mg/week:

* D1 - 41 seconds
* D2 - 41 seconds

575mg/week:

* D1 - 40 seconds
* D2 - 39 seconds

700mg/week:

* D1 - 37 seconds
* D2 - Untested (After seeing the trend, I didn't bother.)

As you can see, I actually IMPROVED my cardio on tren. I've found that dosing Singulair/Montelukast 10mg/ED (standard adult dose) is enough to keep any cardio impact at bay. I'm able to climb more than two flights of stairs, run with dogs (boarder collie, they run forever), and fuck forever. I've yet to notice any sides from it or any possible negative interaction with anything else I'm taking.

**But OTTO, what about tren cough?**

It's not a problem with this. A couple weeks ago I believe I nicked or injected through a vein. Immediately post injection I saw bright red start flowing out of the injection site, not the slow trickle, but a decent flow. I felt my throat tighten and it started to feel uncomfortable, but no cough. After a couple minutes the feeling subsided and all discomfort went away.

**Closing thoughts:**

I'm sure Singulair isn't the only thing out there, any kind of inhale-able corticosteroid or bronchodilator could work in this situation. Anecdotal evidence supports the use of an asthma inhaler as a reactive measure to tren cough, which would also go to support the leukotriene theory. I'm sure my experiment could have been designed better, but I just went with simplicity as the biggest question to me was "Will this even work". If there are any questions, comments, or criticisms, feel free to ask. I'll do my best to answer, but I'm no biology/medicine major.
