I'm staring to get stares when I bench. I'm now doing tricep pushdowns with the whole stack on one of the cable stations. The other one (thats always being used because its in front of mirrors) is usually taken up. BW is up a couple pounds.*

*Notes: In the 5 or so years I have been lifting, 455x10 has been the hardest set of my life by far. I went in knowing I wanted 10 reps, and I am stupid stubborn. By rep 5 I felt like quitting, by 8 I almost racked the bar and gave up. Rep 10 I nearly passed out and it was the longest grind of my life.*
