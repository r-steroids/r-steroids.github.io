*Notes: I decided to bench wide today, normally I do pinkies on rings, I did my index fingers on the ring. 315x12 is a PR, but I'm not sure if pinkies would of been stronger since I haven't done max reps with 315 in a while. I think what I am going to do is on thursdays do overhead press and close grip bench (pinkies on ring) and sundays do wide grip and see how it works out.*

Cable Ab Pulldown: 90x12, 110x12, 110x12

Hanging Leg Raise: bwx20, bwx20, bwx20

*Notes: Toe is a little better, but broken for sure, it's a real bitch to walk. Good news is 545 flew up, so I went for a big PR. I broke 585 off the ground but missed it a little below the knees. It felt like my upper back gave out, need to work on that. However, I know I could of pulled 565, so I feel good about that.

*Notes: Ok, I dropped clen wednesday, started EC and I am at 100 mcg of T3 everyday. I am literally seeing daily changes now. Today's squat workout was absolute shit, 495 felt wayyyy too heavy. I guess this is what they mean when they say T3 saps your strength. Honestly, I'm ok with it because I am leaning up so much. I'm going to step the tren back up to 700 a week to try to combat this as much as possible, because I have also dropped my calories to about 2500 and E/C kills my appetite in the greatest way. I plan on cutting for no more than 3 more weeks, so we'll see how things go.*
