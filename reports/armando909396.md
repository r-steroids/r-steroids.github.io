# Logs

## 9/17/2013
* Woke up real late today but i had no work. Last Friday was my last official pin of my 12 week blast. Today i decided to pin all the test E that was leftover in the vial which came out to 200 mg along with 125 mg of EQ. Had an extreme pump at the gym especially in my arms, forearms was almost painful. Hit my macros spot on today as well, gunna see how i recover overnight.

## 9/29/2013
* 4th injection now and second week into my cruise, starting to notice my pumps are getting bigger at the gym. My shoulders are starting to get a rounded look and my chest seems to be seperating from my delts lol. Weight keeps going up. Pinning however sucks now, switched to 25g needles from 23g and it takes forever to inject. Kept moving the needle around, pretty sure pip is gunna suck.

## 10/13/2013
* Today i noticed that while im eating about the same as before, i used to be stuffed all the time and sometimes even feel ill because of the amount of food i was putting down. Now I am starting to notice that I starting to develop an insatiable hunger even when im sure im full. Veins are starting to pop out in places i didnt think they would. Even though i gained fat during the cycle my quads are starting to show the seperation and well as arms.

## 11/25/2013
* Wow what an incredible fucking month its been. Due to work related issues and working 18 Hours everyday i have had no time to update this until now. EQ was definitely kicking in the last few weeks during my bulk i would eat around 4+ Combo plates of chinese food on top of my protein shakes and such. I was hungry all the time. Not to mention my upper body in no way matches my mid torso due to fat placement now aha. The Eq has definitely been bringing out a ton of veins i never knew existed even when i was a bloated sack. New news now I have decided to start cutting Since the last couple weeks ive been finding it hard to maintain my eating frequency and during the weekends due to certain events i would lose around 10+ pounds of water. Considering i hit 198 at my heaviest i figured it was good to go. I am going to start a small blast of Epistane, Tren, EQ and test e trt. Epistane should begin tomorrow and the tren in a week or so. I am definetly going to be updating this so hopefully you guys check up  on this :)

## 12/4/14 
*Wow the epistane is definitely kicking in. Currently weighing in at 182.6 leaning out and vascularity is increasing. Abs are starting to define a bit more but I'm feeling a bit lethargic all the time. Estro maybe getting a bit too low as I am dosing it 12.5 EOD with stane may do 12.5 E2D and see how that goes. 5 weeks of stane left and tren should be arriving today so I'll keep you guys updated on that and maybe adding 60mg of EQ in 2 weeks well see tho.

## 12/8/14 
* have been depressed the last few days and have been eating like shit so i havent lost anyweight but im still hovering around 183lbs. Epistane is still making me more vascular and im looking more full everyday. Joints are cracking alottttttttt. Hopefully it doesnt worsen might have to jump on some deca this blast if it doesnt get better.
