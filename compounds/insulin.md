First pass...insulin-related reading  
  
[Basic description of different types of insulin, not comprehensive however](http://www.ourdiabetes.com/insulin-therapy.htm)  
  
[Mutant's main insulin-related information page](http://www.everydayfitness.net/insulin.shtml)  
  
[Mutant's Insulin Protocol - doses are too high for beginners, but a straightforward guide to bulking with slin](http://www.everydayfitness.net/insulin-protocal-mutant.html)  
  
[Excellent all-around ebook on anabolic use in bodybuilding, but specific insulin use/resensitization protocols and very interesting information regarding dnp+insulin synergy promoting IGF-1 synthesis](http://tinyurl.com/leu4ndt)  
  
[Two-part post regarding insulin resensitization drugs (metformin/glucophage) and my favorite IGF-promoting, long-acting slin: Lantus](http://www.aussiegymjunkies.com/showpost.php?p=808078&postcount=40)  
  
[Kingtung's overview of insulin use for amateur bodybuilders in conjunction with growth hormone](http://www.aussiegymjunkies.com/showthread.php?t=12344)  
  
Kingtung's excellent synopsis of insulin use:

Take this with a grain of salt, as with anything here of course, but it the basic truism is nearly infallible unless you do something unconventional like dnp+slin for bulking (as described in "Building the Perfect Beast" ebook linked above)
