## Steroids Profiles, Androgenic and Anabolic Rating

Anabolic steroids, technically known as anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), are drugs that are structurally related to the cyclic steroid ring system and have similar effects to testosterone in the body. They increase protein within cells, especially in skeletal muscles. 

Anabolic steroids also have androgenic and virilizing properties, including the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics such as the growth of the vocal cords, testicles (primary sexual characteristics) and body hair (secondary sexual characteristics). The word anabolic comes from the Greek *ἀναβολή* or *anabole*, "that which is thrown up, mound", and the word androgenic from the Greek *ἀνδρός* or *andros*, "of a man" + -*γενής* -*genes*, *“born”*.

### Compound Short-cuts

* [*Nandrolone*](/deca_durabolin.md) *aka* ***Deca***, ***NPP*** — **19-nortestosterone** (***19***\-***nor***). Rated **125**:**37**. Second only to testosterone in terms of popularity as a bulking compound. Water retention, collagen synthesis, joint relief, more gains. [*Experience thread*](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/8ako42/compound_experience_saturday_nandrolone_deca_npp/)*.*

* [*Boldenone*](/equipoise.md) *aka* ***EQ, Equipoise***, ***Parenabol*** — **Testosterone derivative**. Rated **100**:**50**. Metabolites include DHB (*dihydroboldenone*). Steady, dry, lean moderate mass gains, EPO-like stamina, strength and endurance,  appetite increase, collagen synthesis, potent aromatase inhibition, IGF-1 boost, stringent estrogen management requirements. [*Compound Definition*](/equipoise.md). [*Comprehensive EQ Guide*](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/f493l2/daily_ask_anything_20200215/fhqyyqr/), [*Top-level thread*](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/f5aw0b/discussion_eq_equipoise_estrogen_and_ai_effects/)*.* [*Experience thread*](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/854ntj/compound_experience_saturday_boldenone_eq/)*.*

* [*Methenolone*](/primobolan.md) *aka* ***Primo***, ***Primobolan*** — **DHB**/**DHT derivative**. Rated **88**:**57**.  Mild. No sides, dry, lean gains,  collagen synthesis, immune system benefits, “The perfect steroid.” Pricy (±3× test). [*Experience thread*](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/9hzn60/compound_experience_saturday_primo_methenolone/)*.*

* [*Drostanolone*](/masteron.md) *aka* ***Mast***, ***Masteron*** — **DHT derivative**. Rated **62**/**25**. Mild, lean, dry gains. Considered a cutting steroid. As with other DHT analogues, masteron yields increased libido, aggression and strength enhancement in the gym; general confidence and well-being enhancement outside of the gym. [*Experience thread*](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/9dz2ps/compound_experience_saturday_masteron/)*.*

* [*Trenbolone*](/trenbolone.md) *aka* ***Tren***, ***Parabolan*** — **19-nortestosterone** (***19***\-***nor***) **derivative**. Rated **500**/**500**. Recomp, super-effective nutrient partitioning, massive strength gains, dry, grainy look, sides from hell, toxic, tough to out-eat on bulk. [*Experience thread*](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/8oboj2/compound_experience_sunday_trenbolone_aka_tren/)*.*

* [*Trestolone*](/trestolone.md) *aka* ***MENT*** *(7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone)* — **19-nortestosterone** (***19***\-***nor***) **derivative**. Rated **2500**:**650**. Some refer to this compound as a hybrid of Test, Tren and Deca. Lean gains, super anabolic at 10x more myotropic than test. Aromatizes to methyl-estrogen. Can be side heavy. Briefly studied as a male contraceptive, however all studies were halted 2013 with unclear reasons as to why. [*Experience thread*](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/86t5st/compound_experience_saturday_trestolone_trest_ment/)*.* 

* [*Methyltrienolone*](/compounds/methyltrienolone.md) *aka* ***Mtren***, ***Oral Tren*** — **19-nortestosterone** (***19***\-***nor***) **derivative**. Rated **12000**:**6000**. One of the strongest AAS in existence—second only to its double methylated cousin, *dimethyltrienolone*. Said to rank equally to trestolone for rapid, overnight changes in aesthetics and appearance. Extreme surge in strength and aggression. Oft-utilized as a pre-workout or for brief cycles of 3-4 weeks. **Warning**: Highly hepatotoxic. Can be used orally or injected. For toxicity reasons, injection route is highly recommended. [*Experience thread*](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/9g59y3/compound_experience_saturday_metribolone/)*.*

## FAQ
Some answers to common questions.

### What is the difference between Testosterone Enanthate and Testosterone Cypionate?

Approximately nothing. Definitely nothing that is going to make a difference in choosing one or the other for our purposes. Read the specifics below:

* The [ester weights](/compounds/esters.md#wiki_esters_and_the_active_dose) are almost identical, with Cypionate being *ever so-slightly* heavier.  
Meaning there is *ever so-slightly* more actual testosterone hormone (~1%) in Enanthate.

* The [terminal half-life's](/compounds/esters.md#wiki_esters_active_half-life_table) are also almost identical.  
Enanthate is 4.5 days.  
Cypionate is 5 days.

* For some, they may experience a slight difference in potential [Post Injection Pain (PIP)](/thecycle/injecting.md#wiki_pip_.28post_injection_pain.29). This is due to Cypionate having a higher melting point than Enanthate, making Cypionate more prone to being able to cause PIP. This all depends on how your Testosterone was brewed by your source/supplier. [Read more on Post Injection Pain (PIP): Here.](/thecycle/injecting.md#wiki_pip_.28post_injection_pain.29)
