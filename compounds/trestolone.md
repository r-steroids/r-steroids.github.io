## 1. Description

**Trestolone** (**MENT**) is an experimental androgen/anabolic steroid (AAS) and SARM medication under development by the US Government, The Population Council, and university partners for potential use as a form of hormonal birth control for men and for androgen replacement therapy to treat hypogonadism, but has never been marketed for medical use. 

Trestolone is an extremely potent 19-nor derivative oft-described as a cross between Trenbolone and Nandrolone, as “Test on steroids” or “supercharged Test”—yielding all of the most powerful and impressive traits of Deca, Test, and Tren combined, yet without the harsh sides or setbacks. Perhaps more so than any other compound, MENT is highly capable of eliciting serious gains in mass and strength over a relatively short period of time.

### a. Anabolic Rating 

Trestolone delivers 10× more myotropic effect than testosterone. The *myotropic effect* is the effect of building muscle, making Trestolone more effective than any other commercial steroid in existence. Whereas Testosterone's Anabolic to Androgenic ratio is 100:100, and Trenbolone's comes in at 500:500, MENT comes in at 2300:650. 

Trestolone's rating of 2300:650 is higher than nearly any other available compound aside from designer steroid Methyltrienolone, *aka* Mtren, or Metribolone—rated at 12000+:6000+ and also dosed in the microgram range. Metribolone so strong that it's used as the absolute reference standard for laboratory tests to measure androgen receptor (AR) binding—but its acute liver toxicity precludes widespread use. 

### b. A True Testosterone Replacement?

Trestolone is the *only steroid in production today* that is capable of sustaining normal male physiology in the complete absence of testosterone, including sexual functioning. In many users, the compound conveys positive psychological effects including a sense of confidence, euthymia and well-being—effects to some degree shared by DHT-related compounds Testosterone, Dianabol, Proviron and Masteron. However, MENT is not subject to metabolism by the 5α-reductase enzyme, so the compound's psychological benefits are unrelated to the those conveyed by DHT. Unlike sister compound **Dimethandrolone** (**DMAU**), MENT undergoes aromatization, so all the benefits of estrogen will still be conveyed on cycle: extra strength, better glycogen use, androgen receptor upregulation, increased GH output, and boosted IGF-1. 

### c. TRT Dosage

In a 1992 study in rats investigating the pharmacology of MENT, researchers found the anabolic potency of MENT to be 10× greater than Testosterone, while also being 12× more suppressive to the HTPA. The average male produces 4-7mg of testosterone daily to keep muscle mass and sexual function, so 400-700mcg of MENT daily (10× less) is sufficient to produce the same results. A clinical contraceptive study employed doses of one, two and four patches that released 400mcg per day each, for an effective daily dose of 400mcg, 800mcg, and 1600mcg (1.6mg). Clinical studies ranging from 400-700mcg on up to 1-2mg found a close approximation to TRT dose. Given the lack of side effects or negative impact on bloodwork, many bodybuilders have opted to follow an “enhanced” cruise protocol of 5-10mg/day—technically a blast and not a true cruise at all, yet yielding enhanced strength and recovery with minimal impact on measurable markers.

### d. Neuroprotective?

At least one Multiple Sclerosis (MS) study shows MENT to be **neuroprotective** and to *actively repair neurological damage* to the myelin sheath. 

* [The neural androgen receptor: A therapeutic target for myelin repair in chronic demyelination](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235386245_The_neural_androgen_receptor_A_therapeutic_target_for_myelin_repair_in_chronic_demyelination)

> The potent synthetic testosterone analogue 7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT), developed for long-term male contraception and androgen replacement therapy in hypogonadal males and does not stimulate prostate growth, also *efficiently promotes myelin repair*. 
>
> These data establish the efficacy of androgens as remyelinating agents and qualify the brain androgen receptor as a promising drug target for remyelination therapy, thus providing the preclinical rationale for a novel therapeutic use of androgens in males with multiple sclerosis.

Another study that discusses the neuroprotective effects of the SARM RAD140 tangentially mentions  MENT as one of the sole SARMs to be compatible with the aromatase enzyme, hence benefiting from the neuroprotective advantages of metabolite 7α-Methyl-estradiol. 

* [Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator RAD140 Is Neuroprotective in Cultured Neurons and Rats](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3959610/)

### e. Prostate-safe 

Several studies point to MENT's lack of 5α-reductase metabolism and prostate-safe effects. *Prostate cancer is the second leading cancer among aging men in terms of both prevalence and cause of death*, is androgen-dependent, and is typically treated by androgen deprivation therapy. MENT holds potential as safer replacement to Testosterone in these cases.

* [Protective actions of sex steroid hormones in Alzheimer's Disease](https://europepmc.org/article/med/19427328) 

* [ 7*α*\-**methyl**\-19-**nortestosterone** (MENT): the optimal androgen for male contraception](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8489761/)

> There is a need for an androgen preparation that provides appropriate, continuous replacement doses over long periods. An important feature of MENT is that it does not undergo 5*α*\-alpha reduction in prostate as does testosterone. As a consequence, a dose of MENT sufficient to maintain normal muscle mass and gonadotrophin secretion will not hyperstimulate the prostate because its action in this organ is not amplified as is that of testosterone. Thus, MENT can be administered to men with the assurance that it will be less prone to cause diseases of the prostate than testosterone.
>
>	Thus, MENT is less apt to cause benign prostatic hypertrophy and, possibly, prostate cancer than Testosterone. *MENT is the first androgen to promote health* (*i.e*., reduction of the incidence of prostate disease). Clinicians may also be able to use MENT to treat hypogonadism, prostatic hyperplasia, and muscle wasting.
>
> Conclusions: (***1***) *MENT is the first androgen that has a health benefit compared to testosterone*; (***2***) MENT will be promoted as one component of a two-implant system for male contraception, the other component being an implant that will release an LHRH analogue; (***3***) MENT has potential uses in patients with a variety of disorders, including hypogonadism, prostatic hyperplasia and muscle wasting.

### f. Short Half-life 

In a study on MENT's half-life, MENT Acetate was used to determine the rate of hydrolysis of the acetate ester and how quickly elevated MENT plasma levels were reached. The half-life is **VERY** short, calculated to be only 40 minutes for 500mcg of *unesterified* compound injected IV. A Swedish study^(9) injecting MENT IM found a longer half-life of 224 minutes due to the extended absorption time of IM injection. Peak MENT concentrations were dose-dependent and were reached about 1–2 hours after the injections. Daily administration should be sufficient with the Acetate ester. Enanthate and Decanoate formulations with significantly longer half-life values to be injected twice per week and once per week, respectively, are also commercially available. 

### g. Rapid Recovery 

A comprehensive human study conducted on male subjects compared the effects of MENT to Testosterone, both *solo* and accompanied with the progestin Etonogestrel, on spermatogenesis, sex drive, and safety biomarkers associated with androgen use. This was a robust study, containing 29 subjects tested for 48 weeks.^(8)

Participants either received two implant pellets each containing 135mg of MENT acetate calculated to release 400mcg daily, or three 600mg Testosterone pellets, with one given every 12 weeks. Both groups received 68mg of Etonogestrel. Both groups experienced significant reduction in sperm production, with 80% of both groups going from an average of 55×10^6 mL to just 1×10^6 mL after 12 weeks of supplementation.^(8)

Recovery from MENT was *much more rapid* than from Testosterone. The recovery period was 16 weeks for the MENT group, in which *semen concentration increased* to over 20×10^6 mL—whereas the Testosterone group *still had azoospermia* until after 28 weeks.^(8)

### h. Birth Control

* MENT is 12× more suppressive than Testosterone and is under development by USG and university research partners as a rapidly-reversible male oral or implant-based contraceptive. 

* Recovery from MENT is twice as fast as from Testosterone.

#### Contraceptive Studies 

#####⚠️ Efficacy 

* **Months 1-6**: 82% azoospermic

* **Months 6-12**: 100% azoospermic

Testosterone or MENT are oft-paired with a progestin such as etonogestel to further suppress spermatogenesis. 

The results of the following study indicate that MENT alone is sufficient to suppress spermatogenesis, and also that MENT's efficacy as an androgen replacement is unaffected when paired with the second compound.

82% of patients were azoospermia in the **first six months** and 100% of patients were azoospermic in the **second six months** of treatment. 

[Comparison of 7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone effectiveness alone or combined with progestins on androgen receptor mediated-transactivation](https://rep.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/rep/143/2/211.xml)

> Suppression of gonadotropin secretion with exogenously administered testosterone and therefore testicular activity is important for hormone-based male contraception approach.
>
> In this regard, MENT when administered to healthy men leads to gonadotropin suppression and inhibition of spermatogenesis making it potentially useful as a male contraceptive (von Eckardstein et al. 2003). 
>
>In the case of testosterone, combination with gonadotropin-inhibiting agents such as progestins results in a more effective formulation for spermatogenic suppression than testosterone alone (Bebb et al. 1996). 
>
>Recently,  Walton et al. (2007) showed that combination of MENT with a progestin resulted in rapid inhibition of spermatogenesis similar to the combined testosterone formulation and pointed out the importance of the synthetic progestin dose over the androgen dose in improving spermatogenesis suppression.
>
> However, **subjects treated with four MENT implants exhibited higher and longer spermatogenesis suppression than subjects treated with two MENT implants plus two ENG implants** (Walton et al. 2007). 
>
>Four MENT implants induced azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia (sperm count <1×10^6/ml) in 82% and 100% of subjects during the first and second 6-month periods of treatment respectively. Thus, during the last 6 months of treatment, **MENT alone was as effective as testosterone undecanoate plus NET enanthate** administered at 8-week intervals.

## 2. Administration Guidelines 

Weekly dosage is low. In clinical studies, the injectable pellets used released between 400-700 micrograms per day as replacement for natural Testosterone production values that fall between 4-7 milligrams per day, given that MENT is ten times more myotropic than Testosterone. Contraceptive studies found that implants timed to release 400, 800 and 1600 mcg per day were well-tolerated. 400-700mcg on up to 1-2mg were employed by clinical studies as an approximate translation to TRT. Given the complete lack of side effects and the nominal impact on bloodwork, many bodybuilders opt to follow an “enhanced” cruise protocol of MENT at 5-10mg/day. 

Trestolone is intended be taken *solo* as a replacement or paired with Testosterone. For weightlifting purposes good results and accelerated progress can be made at doses as little as 5-10mg/day. Commonly-used blast doses range from 10-25mg (70-175/wk), 25-50mg (175-350/wk), on up to 100mg per day (700/wk). The average cycle settles upon 25-35mg/day. Acetate ester blasts are typically 8 weeks in duration, whereas Enanthate and Decanoate are longer at 12-20 weeks. 

There's no need to rush into taking higher doses. Harm reduction would dictate administering the minimum required and titrating dose upwards. Pairing with Test conveys estrogen's protective benefits. In sensitive individuals, side effects such as high blood pressure, gynecomastia, or night sweats may manifest at the higher end of the dosage range, making it imperative to have AI on hand and to titrate up from cruise. 

As MENT is designed as a prostate-safe replacement for Testosterone in TRT, following completion of the blast phase one can simply drop back down to a cruise. Trestolone is extremely well-tolerated, and the complete absence of sides at the therapeutic dosing range—coupled with its impressive anabolic response–makes Trestolone a unique addition to the contemporary range of anabolic compounds.

### a. Example Cycle

MENT has long been run *Solo* **OR** *paired* with TRT doses of Testosterone (typically 80-150mg). The following holds for **Trestolone Acetate**. Enanthate and Decanoate esters take far longer to reach saturation, so weekly changes would be too quick to discern sufficient metrics before moving forward. 

Trestolone is intended as a rapidly-reversible male contraceptive and as a replacement for Testosterone in HRT. Long-term clinical research found no adverse effects or problems in long-term studies of 48 weeks that administered Trestolone solo. Anecdotal reports from some users indicate MENT is better when paired with TRT levels of Testosterone. This is particularly advisable from a medical perspective given the neuroprotective and cardioprotective benefits conveyed by estradiol. 

* As a short-ester Acetate, injections should occur every day. MENT doesn't bind to SHBG, so it's fully metabolized in no time flat. 

* **Week One**. Start with a *Cruise* dose of ~1mg and note any effects on strength, training and recovery. 

* Try a week or so going up to 5mg/day. Again pay close attention to any mental or physical changes. How are sleep, mood, appetite affected? Many users experience heretofore unheard-of physique and strength gains, and record-shattering PR (1RM) lifts, even at this low dose regime. 

* If you're interested in taking it higher, work your way to 10mg.  Closely keep track of any changes along the way. Keep in mind clinical studies haven't been conducted above ~2mg per day. 

* If well-tolerated, the daily dose is oft-taken to 25mg, splitting into multiple injections to reduce the potential of side effects.

* Many bodybuilders have taken MENT to 50, 75—even 100mg. *Less conservative* coaches recommend starting MENT at 30mg/day and quickly moving on up to 50mg/day+.

* *Safety studies haven't yet been conducted anywhere near this high*, so you're in uncharted terrain. This is the principle reason for titrating from ~1mg.

* When the cycle is complete, choose between termination of the cycle or dropping back down to a cruise (400–700 micrograms per day) or “enhanced cruise” (2–5mg). MENT is intended to serve as a prostate-safe, healthy replacement for TRT—so it's not unheard of to blast and cruise with it as oft-practiced with Testosterone.

Yet again: there's no need to rush into higher doses just because they're the prevailing paradigm. *Harm reduction would dictate administering the minimum required and titrating dose upwards*. In sensitive individuals, side effects such as high blood pressure, gynecomastia, or night sweats may manifest at the higher end of the dosage range, making it imperative to *titrate up* from cruise.

Many users experience massive improvement in physique and *lifetime PRs* on as little as 5 mg per day. Why not keep the doses low, keep your wallet intact, and save the megadoses for later? There's *no need to rush* into anything higher. In taking it slowly the first time, you'll find your sweet spot, save your wallet, and simultaneously *guarantee* the absence of adverse side effects.

### b. Super bloat? Crazy gyno? 

Concerned by the sides mentioned in the older Compound Experience Threads?

*Don't believe the hype.* 

A MENT solo cruise as HRT/TRT replacement for 22 consecutive weeks [yields estrogen values](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/nlgfsc/daily_ask_anything_20210526/gzjlog1/) of about *5* pg/mL as shown on LC-MS/MS sensitive bloodwork. 

**Equipotent to E2** — 7α-Methylestradiol is [*equipotent* to estrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7α-Methylestradiol) at the receptor. It isn't some magical powerful gyno trigger—especially when you're taking a few milligrams per day. *Aromatization issues are completely overblown*.

**Aromatizes at the same rate as Nandrolone** — [This chart](https://imgur.com/a/D9vCY5g) from [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2575079/) demonstrates that MENT has an equivalent aromatization rate as Nandrolone (Deca, or 19-nortestosterone).^10

The only exceptional characteristic of MENT's 7α-Methylestradiol is its methylation, which can arguably make it slower to metabolize. Yet this feature is shared with Dianabol's active metabolite, 17α-Methylestradiol, and people aren't lining up with alarmist cries to denounce Dianabol for crazy and uncontrollable sides. 

Simply start low and titrate to tolerance. If you encounter sides, lower the dose. MENT's halflife is on order of minutes. *Its rapid metabolism makes any sides self-limiting.*

***Keep AI on-hand*** *in case of gyno or high estrogen sides*, but don't pop AI like candy or you'll crash your E2 levels. 

**Veteran input** 

Input from r/steroids veteran contributors:

> **Review** from u/platewrecked: The side effects are the stuff of broscience. Those old writeups are like they were taking a completely different compound. A bunch of us have been playing with it over the last couple of years and only a small number of guys running substantial MENT cycles need any AI at all and I don’t know a single user who got gyno from MENT.

Or review [these recent comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/n5fceq/daily_ask_anything_20210505/gx2wic9/?context=3) and subsequent [reply from BicepBandito](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/n5fceq/daily_ask_anything_20210505/gx32oyh/?context=3) in regards to the disinformation and broscience so prevalent in the early Experience Threads.

> **Review** from u/BicepBandito: MENT is my favorite steroid ever after just one run with it. I feel like those old Compound Experience threads were guys just parroting stuff they’d read. Often if you’re expecting sides, you’ll find them if you look hard enough, even if they’re not actually there. *Placebo works both ways*.
>
> MENT used to be *sooo* rare, and wildly expensive, that only a handful of really experienced guys had run it. Not so anymore. Price has come down considerably, and most underground labs seem to be carrying it nowadays. Everyone I know personally that’s run it has reported *zero sides* other than blood pressure issues at higher doses. I’ve seen *one person* report low *T* symptoms when he tried to run it solo.
>
> I have pretty bad pubertal gyno that Tren fucks with. I ran MENT paired with EQ, and didn’t touch an AI for my entire cycle. Nothing. At. All. Not a single side effect, other than getting swole as fuck. When I bumped it from 350 to 700, I couldn’t control my BP even with lots of cardio and meds, so I had to lower it back to 350. That's it. 
>
>It’s almost like today’s MENT is a different drug altogether from those old threads. Maybe synthesizing techniques have changed and it slightly altered things since then? Maybe guys had themselves under the *placebo effect* seeing all these sides that they expected so badly? I assume it’s the latter. *Anyhooo*. Yeah. That’s the *real* story.

Here's some ***more recent***—and hence relevant—Compound Experience Threads:

* [July 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/hcmk9e/compound_trestolone_trest_ment/) *Trestolone Compound Experience Thread*

* [January 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/kg8lif/compounds_trestolone_aka_trest_ment/) *Trestolone Compound Experience Thread*

* [June 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/o49ywj/compounds_trestolone_or_ment/) *Trestolone Compound Experience Thread*

### c. Estrogen Management

MENT doesn’t directly impact estradiol (E2). As 7α-Methylestradiol (7α-Me-E2), its estrogen is similar to the 17α-Methylestradiol (17α-Me-E2) produced by Dianabol, and it doesn't show on bloodwork. 

When adding MENT to an existing stack, the Equipoise or Primobolan ratio doesn't matter so much as the dose of Testosterone you're taking unless you're going solo. 

If you start MENT and begin to experience sides, take a normal dose of AI and/or simply lower the dose. MENT is metabolized quickly, so more frequent dosing will cut down on spikes.

As some users report trouble managing aromatization with MENT, *have Aromasin, Nolvadex or Raloxifine at the ready*. Fortunately, the majority of users present with no sides. If you follow the Wiki guidelines and titrate up from a cruise, this should never become an issue.

* “MENT is a side-effect-free, more powerful and effective love child of Trenbolone and Nandrolone that's so *ridiculously perfect* it feels almost too good to be true.”

* “I experienced *no issues* at 350mg a week last off-season and I have absolutely zero idea why anyone would need to run MENT higher than that.”

* “I have bad pubertal gyno and have run MENT up to 700 *without a single side* other than BP.”

### d. Solo? Or no?

Some prefer to run MENT with Testosterone, some prefer to run it solo. In absence of a medical condition such as a prostate condition that necessitates using MENT solo, it's recommended to try it both ways to ascertain personal preference.  

In part this depends on how one responds to DHT, or the absence thereof, as replaced by another potent androgen (MENT).

Most have no problems running it solo, but one early adopter experienced a subtle loss of drive and motivation that was corrected by reintroducing Test at TRT levels. Since then, many others have run it solo for months to years at a time without any negative sides or problems. 

Test is cheap, so there's no problem in continuing to run it at TRT levels just to be conservative. Others who aromatize more heavily may prefer to run MENT solo so they aren't doubling up on estrogen management.
