⚠️ **Disclaimer: Reading this entire profile is imperative to ensuring proper administration. Always exercise caution. Safe & side-free use is ENTIRELY POSSIBLE simply by following a few basic common sense precautions.**

##**What is DNP?**

DNP is the most powerful compound available for the reduction of body fat. On a cycle of 250–600mg/day, the average user will lose 1lb+ of body fat a day. This is not without a price, as DNP overdose may result in death. Researching DNP as thoroughly as possible is vital to ensuring maximum safety of use. 

##**How does DNP work?**

DNP inhibits ATP production in cell mitochondria through uncoupling the metabolic pathway oxidative phosphorylation. This has two consequences which result in fat loss:

- Instead of being converted into ATP, all consumed and stored macromolecules are converted into significant amounts of heat, which in turn raises body temperature and increases the bodies basal metabolic rate between 50–75% depending on dose. 

- When your ATP levels fall below the necessary range for your body to function properly, your body attempts to convert all stored glycogen and fat into ATP. Since the body cannot achieve this, the body burns from stored energy reserves (fat) for the entirety of time that you run DNP. 

\* *An overdose of DNP* ***will*** *lead to fatal hyperthermia. This is COMPLETELY AVOIDABLE by following the basic precautions below. The first cycle of DNP use will ultimately be the most vital to understanding how your body reacts to the compound and how to utilize it safely.*

***

##**How to use DNP** 

**Beginner (First) Cycle examples:**

Begin use at ~200mg/day for 3-4 days. 

- After 4 days, continue 200mg/day for an additional 10-17 days.

**OR**

- If you don't experience significant side effects, you may feel free to ramp up to 400mg/day for an additional 10 days.

When DNP was in common use, the dose was usually around 300 mg/day. A 1934 JAMA paper details doses and cycle lengths:

* [Use of Dinitrophenol in Nutritional Disorders: A Critical Survey of Clinical Results](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1558869/)

**Advanced Cycles:**

Advanced DNP users can safely cycle on up to 800mg/day. Generally, cycles range from 200-800mg. We most often see 200mg/day cycles from advanced users lasting ~30 days. This can be considered a cruise dose. A blast dose of 600mg+ is usually run for 14-21 days. 

**A note on safety: The higher dose and longer time that DNP is run, the higher the potential for adverse effects.** 

\* *Users have been known to run upwards of* ***more than one gram per day*** *for extended periods. This is not only overkill but it is also extremely dangerous, as over 1g/day for extended periods of time can put you either just below, at, or above the overdose limit, depending on your weight. Most users who will dose 1 gram do so as either a frontload or once a week as an added boost.* ***Again, this is not necessary or recommended.***

**[Graph of blood level accumulation based on dose/time](http://i.imgur.com/TUGgzjn.jpg)**

***

##**Guidelines for use:** 

- Do NOT use DNP in hot environments. Extended periods of time in the sun, use in a sauna, steam room, *etc* can cause fatal hyperthermia.

- Do NOT consume alcohol while on DNP. This is far more important than the dangers of consuming alcohol with oral steroids, as this relates to hyperthermia, not liver damage. 

- Do NOT take diuretics while using DNP. 

- Drink 2–3 gallons of water or more a day.

- Discontinue use if your oral temperature rises above 103 degrees. Continue use of a lower dose when temperature returns to normal.

- Supplement with electrolytes

- Optional: Supplement with antioxidants to prevent free radical damage from fat oxidation and glycerol to prevent the potential for muscle catabolism. T3 may also be taken in small doses to maintain energy levels while on cycle.

## Side effects (Mild)

- Intense feelings of heat [Dose dependent]

-  Perspiration [Dose dependent]

- Lethargy [Simple sugars (fructose) will mitigate]

- Insomnia [Dose/user dependent]

- Shortness of breath [Dose/user dependent] 

- Headache [Infrequent, user dependent] 

- Dry/Sore throat [Infrequent, user dependent] 

- Yellowing of the eyes [Dose dependent, often cured by increase in water intake, NOT A RESULT OF LIVER DAMAGE] 

- Yellowing of semen/urine/sweat [Dose dependent, often cured by increase in water intake] 

## Side effects (Uncommon)

These side effects are INCREDIBLY RARE - and are ALL a result of OVERDOSE, EXTREMELY LONG CYCLES, gender and age specific. 

- Cataracts [In a trial of 100,000 people, less than ~0.1% developed cataracts. These were predominantly women aged ~45, who used DNP for ~11 months, and developed cataracts ~7-15 months after use. In the VERY RARE cases of males ~22-25 recently developing cataracts, they ran DNP at 1g+ daily for extended periods of time]

- Peripheral Neuropathy [This may first present as numbness. Symptoms include tingling, pain, itching, crawling, and pins and needles. Pain can become intense enough to require use of opioid (narcotic) drugs.] [See this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/2ngfzi/psa_dnp_peripheral_neuropathy/) for a user's experience. Dose and duration dependent. Preventable if you stop upon onset of symptoms. 

- Death [Death is due to overdose resulting in fatal hyperthermia - COMPLETELY AVOIDABLE by following the conservative dosing protocols discussed above]

***

##**Additional notes:** 

- During the first 3–4 days of use, DNP will deplete your body of glycogen. The full range of DNP's side effects will NOT be observable until after this time frame. This is why ramping up for a first time use is necessary. 

- When your body lacks glycogen your muscles appear flat and small. DNP will also force your body to retain a LOT of water. These two consequences result in a physique opposite of the desired results from DNP use. THIS IS TEMPORARY. Your body will lose all water weight and replenish glycogen ~5 days after cycle. Until then, be aware that your appearance and weight will be deceiving.

- DNP is Yellow. DNP has been used as an incredibly strong yellow dye. This potential is what causes yellowing of the eyes and semen, among other fluids such as sweat and urine. This is nothing to be concerned about, and increases in water consumption often prevents this. 

- If you take DNP and develop a rash or hives IMMEDIATELY discontinue use. A rash indicates allergy to DNP. The allergic reaction will subside without medical intervention - and there IS a protocol to overcoming the allergy, but I will not cover it here. 

- It is not advised to do heavy exercise while on DNP. 

- DNP may cause nausea if taken on an empty stomach. 

- A good protocol for DNP use is before bed (on a single dose) or before bed and upon waking (multiple doses). 

- Split large doses equal hours apart if possible. 

- Eating carbs while on DNP will cause your body to produce a temporary heat wave - it is thought the carbs are being instantly burned away.  

- DNP comes in two forms: Crystal and Powder. It is generally believed that powder is more potent than crystal by a ratio of ~5:4

- Your body CANNOT BUILD A TOLERANCE to DNP. Don't listen to anyone saying otherwise. This is both a positive and negative attribute. While you can take DNP at a single dose for as long as you want, this is also precisely the reason that a fatal overdose is cause for alarm. If overdosed, your body does not possess a method for saving itself. 

- DNP will cause your body to stop creating T3. At 200mg/day, this is usually seen around day 10. At 400mg-600mg/day, this can be seen as early as day 3. Supplementing with T3 is advisable.

*While this compound profile attempts to explain everything known about DNP in an effort to ensure maximum safety of use, as with anything, individual use will vary. Always exercise caution when using DNP.*

##**New Developments**

* *Science Magazine*, Yale University [Dinitrophenol: A Possible Comeback](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/03/03/dinitrophenol_a_possible_comeback)

A time-released version of DNP is under development as a **cure for liver disease and diabetes**. The Shulman group at Yale is currently developing a *low toxicity* time-released version of *radical fat burner* and *mitochondrial decoupler* DNP as a means of altogether reversing Type II diabetes and liver disease. 

>	*Metabolic uncoupling* is a promising diabetes therapy. The idea is that your mitochondria will plow though large amounts of lipids under these conditions, and there’s plenty of evidence that knocking down free fatty acids and tissue lipid stores would be of great benefit for Type II patients. The problem is that this therapy has a well-deserved reputation for having a low therapeutic index.

>	2,4-dinitrophenol is a pretty unlikely-looking drug, but it most certainly has metabolic effects. It was on the market for a while many decades ago as a weight-loss therapy, and no one can say that it won’t make you lose weight. The danger is that you lose it all the way down to your dry bone mass, because it doesn’t take much extra DNP to give you dangerous amounts of overheating and perhaps even a critical shortage of ATP, which frivolous organs like your heart and brain seem to have become dependent on. 

>	This formulation does a dramatic job of reversing diabetes symptoms in rodent models, and fatty liver disease as well. Shulman is working on taking this toward human clinical trials, and the animal results make a good case. 

* [Controlled-release mitochondrial protonophore reverses diabetes and steatohepatitis in rats](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6227/1253.abstract?sid=c6d032c9-7438-41f0-9b9a-2ec2b798670e)

* [Banned weight-loss drug could combat liver disease, diabetes](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/02/banned-weight-loss-drug-could-combat-liver-disease-diabetes)

Contra widespread misconception, *DNP decreases oxidative stress*, rather than increased ROX, and increased maximum lifespan in rats. 

Mitochondrial uncoupling *evolved as a protective mechanism* against the excessive production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS). 

* [The mitochondrial uncoupler 2,4‐dinitrophenol attenuates tissue damage and improves mitochondrial homeostasis following transient focal cerebral ischemia](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2005.03328.x)

### DNP as Powerful Antioxidant 

DNP **decreases** oxidative stress, as demonstrated in the following study.

[Mild mitochondrial uncoupling in mice affects energy metabolism, redox balance and longevity](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1474-9726.2008.00407.x)

>	Treatment of mice with low doses of the protonophore 2,4‐dinitrophenol promotes enhanced tissue respiratory rates, improved serological glucose, triglyceride and insulin levels, *decrease of reactive oxygen species levels and tissue DNA and protein oxidation* as well as reduced body weight.

### Uncoupling protects against ROS 

[Mitochondrial uncoupling as a regulator of life-history trajectories in birds: an experimental study in the zebra finch](https://jeb.biologists.org/content/217/19/3579)

>	Mitochondria have a fundamental role in the transduction of energy from food into ATP. The coupling between food oxidation and ATP production is never perfect, but may nevertheless be of evolutionary significance. The ‘uncoupling to survive’ hypothesis suggests that ‘mild’ 
*mitochondrial uncoupling evolved as a protective mechanism against the excessive production of damaging reactive oxygen species* (ROS).

### DNP as Medicine 

Low-dose DNP garners additional medicinal benefits beyond enhanced longevity and disease treatment, and a reduced risk profile. DNP also demonstrates *nootropic* properties. The compound shows utility in *improving cognition, slowing aging and attenuating neurodegeneration*. 

* [2,4 Dinitrophenol as Medicine](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/8/3/280/htm) 

>	DNP appears to mimic in part the *neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects of exercise* and fasting by *increasing BDNF*, *lowering cellular stress* and *building cellular resiliency* by mild increases in mitochondrial bioenergetics. 

>	If ROS production were managed, could disease onset due to *aging be delayed or prevented*? Is it possible that most, if not all neurodegenerative diseases are manifested through mitochondrial dysfunction? 

>It is known that mitochondrial uncouplers specifically target the entire organelle’s physiology *non-genomically*. Unexpected drug findings will be discussed, such as DNP’s induction of *neurotrophic growth factors* involved in neuronal health, learning and cognition.

### Neuroprotection

[Neuroprotective actions of 2,4-dinitrophenol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5619426/)

### Cancer Treatment

2,4-Dinitrophenol raises body temperature by forcing the cells of the human body to create ATP less efficiently from glucose. Cancer cells have almost 200× output of ATP and work overtime in doing so. When stimulated by the DNP their mitochondria will act like a little furnace creating the demise of the cancer cell well before the healthy cells die from the DNP.

### Analogue Uncouplers

#### BAM15 

Another example of *powerful antioxidant effects*, sister compound BAM15 is also a mitochondrial uncoupler.

[Mitochondrial uncoupler BAM15 reverses diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in mice](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16298-2)

>	BAM15 decreases hepatic fat, decreases inflammatory lipids, and has *strong antioxidant effects*.

[BAM15, the ‘light’ version of DNP](https://www.ergo-log.com/bam15.html)

#### Aspirin

None other than *over-the-counter Aspirin* also happens to be a mitochondrial uncoupler. 

* [Salicylic Acid Is an Uncoupler and Inhibitor of Mitochondrial Electron Transport](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC316328/)

### Diabetes & Obesity 

[BAM15 Mediated Mitochondrial Uncoupling Protects Against Obesity and Improves Glycemic Control](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/emmm.202012088), *EMBO Molecular Medicine* (June 2020)

[Study discovers BAM15 as a potential treatment for obesity](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-06-bam15-potential-treatment-obesity.html)

>	A new study offers the first evidence that a protein named BAM15 acts as an energy uncoupler and could be an effective drug for treating obesity and related diseases. Obesity affects more than 650 million people worldwide and drives a number of dangerous health conditions, including *Type 2 diabetes, heart disease* and *more than a dozen deadly cancers*. BAM15 works by making the mitochondria, the power plants of the cell, less efficient. The result is that the mitochondria burn more energy; this could be used to treat a number of health conditions including **diabetes**, fatty *liver disease* and some forms of *cancer*.

Other benefits include: 

* **Reducing blood sugar** and insulin levels independently of weight loss.

* **Improving insulin sensitivity** in skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is a primary risk factor for the development of Type II diabetes.

* **Reducing fat accumulation** by restricting fat from building up in the liver, kidney, and blood. Accumulating too much fat in one’s liver, kidneys, or blood can damage the organs and lead to heart disease.

### Future Applications

>	It is possible to wake up redundant cellular compensatory mechanisms by modulating the mitochondria’s entire physiology towards pro-survival of the cell, with a brain penetrant, *simple oral dosing of DNP to attenuate disease progression* for a broad number of indications, *slow aging*, and the potential in the future to *prophylactically treat patients* to entirely *prevent the myriad of age-related illnesses*.^1

A number of unexploited **medicinal use cases** encompass an entire class of novel applications:

* Diabetes
* Liver disease
* Cancer
* Cognition
* Cellular Remodeling
* BDNF Induction
* Neuroprotection
* Huntington Disease
* Alzheimer’s Disease
* Parkinson Disease
* Multiple sclerosis
* Optic neuritis
* Ischemia
* Sciatic Nerve Damage
* Traumatic Brain Injury
* Hearing Loss
* Neuromuscular Diseases
* Metabolic Syndrome
* Epilepsy
* Rett Syndrome
* Stroke
* Pompe
* Wolfram Syndrome
* Friedreich ataxia

... *to name a few.* ^1

Low-dose DNP shows promise as treatment or preventative pro-health and pro-longevity supplement at physiologically-relevant doses *orders-of-magnitude* lower than those used for weight loss.
