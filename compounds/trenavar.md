# Trenavar

**Chemical structure:** Estra-4,9,11-triene-3,17-dione (C_18 H_20 O_2)

**Molecular weight of base:** 268.350189 (isotopic average)

**Active Life:** unknown, presumably short like most orals

**Anabolic/Androgenic Ratio:** unknown, presumably comparable to trenbolone

## Use/Dosing
**Trenavar** is a *prohormone* that converts directly to trenbolone in the body. [Trenbolone](http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/trenbolone) is a well-known, extremely potent injectable steroid; it is a strong androgen with no estrogenic activity that causes great strength gains, increase in lean muscle mass, and fat loss, though many users report harsh side effects (see [the wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/trenbolone) on trenbolone for more detail).  

Conversion to trenbolone should be high, so effects should be identical to the injectable form. Trenbolone is one of the strongest injectable steroids on the market, so effects experienced from Trenavar can be expected to be largely the same: huge strength and size increases, accelerated fat loss, and enhanced vascularity.

It's recommended to start between 60-90mg/day, working your way up until the sides are too much.  Anecdotal evidence for higher doses (up to 250mg/day) exists, see links below. Average cycles are typically 4-6 weeks, and should be run with a test base.

## Side Effects/Risks

Blood pressure is likely to be elevated to a significant degree in a dose-dependent fashion. Cholesterol levels and liver function markers are likely to be adversely affected. Commonly-reported sides include night-sweats, mood swings, hair loss and/or growth, temporary loss of libido, as well as the suppression of endogenous testosterone production.
