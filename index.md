## What Are Steroids?

The term "steroids" refers to a *class of hormones with a classic polyphenol ring structure that are derived from the cholesterol molecule*. There are two types of steroids that are often confused: **Anabolic** and **Catabolic**. These two steroids serve different medical purposes.

### Catabolic Steroids (Glucocorticoids)

Catabolic steroids (also commonly referred to as glucocorticoids or corticosteroids) are a group of steroid hormones produced in the adrenal cortex or made synthetically. They have various metabolic functions and are used to treat systemic inflammation.

**Glucocorticoids are utilized to treat:**

* Arthritis
* Asthma
* Autoimmune diseases such as lupus and multiple sclerosis
* Skin conditions such as eczema and rashes
* Some kinds of cancer

Side effects of glucocorticoids can include fat gain (particularly trunk), muscle atrophy, weakened bones, and cataracts.

### Anabolic-Androgenic Steroids (AAS)

Anabolic steroids (more formally anabolic-androgenic steroids, or AAS) are synthetic steroid hormone that resemble testosterone and promote the growth of muscle tissue. Such hormones are used medicinally to treat some forms of weight loss and by some athletes and others to enhance physical performance.

**Use of anabolic steroids can have side effects including:**

* Acne and cysts
* Breast growth and shrinking of testicles in men
* Voice deepening and growth of body hair
* Heart problems, including heart attack
* Liver disease, including cancer
* Aggressive behavior

See *[Additional Sides](/sides/list.md)*

### How Do Anabolic Steroids Work?

There are generally considered to be three mechanisms of action of AAS.

1. By binding to the androgen receptor located in the cytoplasm, AAS stimulate protein synthesis in the muscle. 
2. AAS bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, blocking the catabolic actions of cortisol on muscle (protein breakdown).
3. Psychological effects include increased motivation and aggression, leading to increased training intensity.

See *[Pharmacology of AAS](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2439524/).*

### Are AAS Dangerous?

The general consensus is that if used properly, in conjunction with blood tests, AAS can be used safely. However, the potential side effects can be extreme if they are used incorrectly. Most commonly, a lipid profile imbalance which favors plaque deposition in the arteries occurs. The strict diet of most bodybuilders means this is minimized by a low fat intake.

Liver problems can occur with the use of 17α-alkylated oral anabolic steroids. Rare cases of hepatic peliosis (blood filled cysts in the liver), more commonly known as a liver cancer, have been associated with the use of oral AAS. While these cases have been rare, they emphasize the need for blood testing during a cycle.

Gynecomastia can occur as a result of high levels of Testosterone being partially converted to estrogen, the primary metabolite being estradiol (E2). The enzyme responsible for this conversion is called *aromatase*. It can be inhibited by a class of drugs called Aromatase Inhibitors (AI). Another class of drugs called a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM), such as Raloxifine or Nolvadex, can also be used because it blocks estrogen from binding with the estrogen receptor, rather than the binding with the enzyme that metabolizes from Testosterone to Estrogen.

### Are There Any Long-Term Effects?

AAS have been used in humans to improve performance since the 1930s. This was a crude extract from male dog urine. Nazi paratroopers were thought to be the first to take Testosterone for performance. In the fifties, drug development company Ciba developed Dianabol—and the race was then on to find the best steroid in terms of anabolic-androgenic dissociation.

The long history of use by many thousands of people has shown that if used reasonably, most people do not experience any long-term adverse effects. However, there is a distinct lack of research in this area, with the occasional case study in the medical literature. The mass media likes to sensationalize the death of any past steroid user.

The fact is, the most likely problem would be an increase in arterial plaque deposition as a result of an unfavorable blood lipid levels. This does not affect all users, hence another reason for blood testing.

**There is strong evidence to suggest that brief exposure to anabolic steroids might have long lasting performance-enhancing effects**:

### Should I Begin Taking Anabolic Steroids?

*The generally accepted criteria for starting AAS is as follows:*

1. Research until you have a very good understanding of what you are considering putting into your body. **Do this PRIOR to your cycle**.

2. Do not run a cycle without having a **PCT** and an **AI** on hand. If you can't afford either, you can't afford to cycle.

3. The best first cycle is a simple first cycle. **KISS** (Keep It Simple Stupid!). As more experience is gained and you learn how your body reacts to gear, cycles can become more complex. Adding two previously unused elements to a cycle makes it impossible to know which thing may be causing issues. One new compound at a time, and grow into your dose. You don't need grams and grams of gear. 

4. Steroids are not magic. The key is a very good *caloric surplus*, **healthy diet** and **progressive overload exercise** regime. With these factors in place, keep your expectations reasonable and you'll be happy.

5. For your cycle duration, **remain aware** of how your body is reacting both physically and emotionally. If something feels "off" or "not right", and it's not a known side, it probably isn't right. Typical beginner cycles make people feel very good overall.

## Can I Do This Naturally?

You will eventually reach a genetic potential maximum ([calculate yours here](https://dioxyme.com/pages/maximum-muscular-potential-calculator)) with regards to strength and size. There are often people giving advice to "reach your genetic maximum potential first" before using gear. Some at /r/steroids give and promote this advice, some do not. This advice is preference.

## Why Young Men Should Not Take AAS

**Introduction** 

Exogenous androgens act as epigenetic growth signaling termination factors. What this translates to is that it isn't just your height that's stunted. It's your IQ. AAS can atrophy brain development and higher cognitive functions. Clinical studies showed this can lead to ***long-term aggression, anxiety, depression, cognitive deficits and memory problems***—*among others.*

Until then it is advised that individuals train naturally. Those suffering from low testosterone symptoms should *first* address lifestyle practices and environmental factors that may be causing issues. After underlying issues have been addressed with no results; Clomid monotherapy or hCG-only cycles function as far safer alternatives to taking steroids. Read the Wiki section on hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). Consult with a family physician for a referral to an endocrinologist. 

Young adults up into their early twenties are at peak Testosterone output, peak natty growth potential, and the perfect time to bulk naturally.  

MRI scans show that the adolescent brain and neuroendocrine system growth and development continues until the age of 25. The last regions to finish growing are the *absolute most important—those associated with consciousness, sense of self, abstract reasoning, conscientiousness, high-bandwidth emotional processing, higher cognition and impulse control*. 

*While still under the age of* 25, the fragile connections that make up your newly-forged neural pathways are far more exposed and vulnerable to the potential for permanent damage than previously set, well-worn and established pathways. 

**What's safe?**

For hypogonadal patients *under the age of 25* the standard of care medical professionals advise for the treatment of low Testosterone levels is either (a) *hCG* or (b) *Clomid monotherapy*. Each option has its own unique side effects, relative merits and disadvantages—but either one of these two options are far safer, and nowhere near risking the debilitating negative side effects that can come as a consequence of AAS mismanagement or abuse.

**What are the different risks?**

>“Anabolic steroids have been reported to induce psychiatric side effects such as *aggression* and *depression*. Adolescence represents an *extremely sensitive neurodevelopmental period* to influence by *detrimental effects*.”

– *Side Effects of Drugs Annual*

>“AAS use by teenagers is a primary concern because of the potential side effects where *remodeling of the brain and behavioral maturation* occurs.”

– *Journal of Behavioral Processes*

> “AAS use *impaired spatial learning and memory*, and this effect was not rescued by exercise. The harmful effects of AAS on learning and memory should be taken into account when athletes decide to use them for performance or body image improvement.” 

> “Testosterone and anabolic steroids have been found to affect the central nervous system (CNS) in humans and laboratory animals. The locations they affect include centers that regulate mood, sexuality and aggression. People who use steroids in excessive doses often experience mood disorders that meet the criteria of psychiatric disease categories such as *depression*, *anxiety*, *psychotic reactions* and *cognitive deterioration*.”

– *Anabolic Steroids Cause Longstanding Changes in the Brain*

Until you're around **the age of 25**,^[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621648/), ^[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19609250/) your brain and endocrine system are still developing. This should be obvious as you are still going through the end of puberty, getting acne, etc. During this time period, supplementing with exogenous hormones is *extremely dangerous*.

Taking *anything* before completely finishing puberty can have negative side effects. While still maturing, the brain, organs, and cells are consistently gauging the overall development of the body. When a foreign substance is introduced, the body’s ability to truly judge how far along your maturation is, resulting in the possibility of premature shutdown or stunting your growth and development processes.

**Don't Short-Circuit Your Natural Blast**

The body is already pumping out blast levels of Testosterone as part of the natural course of late adolescence. It's the highest that it's ever going to be. During this time there is a [30 fold increase](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25151053/) in testosterone production priming them for growth. During this time the body needs to 'learn' to create these hormones and to stabilize their production. By introducing exogenous hormones this inhibits the body from adequately forming the ability to perform this function on its own. This can create the possibility of decreased quality of life down the line.

There's a serious potential for long-term side effects. People oft-say “I've stopped growing, so it's okay.” No: it's not okay. The rest of you hasn't finished developing yet. There are many other potential side effects besides simply your growth plates. Here are a few; Brain Function, Memory, Alzheimers Disease...

It's well known that hormones play a role in the development of cognitive brain function. Your neuroendocrine system is still developing until around the age of 25. 

**Premature Closing of Growth Plates**

This one is the most known about. Even if you think you've stopped growing, there still is a potential for height increase over time. Scientists have found that growth plates don't fuse completely in some cases until individuals are past 22. Don't be deterred just because you haven't grown taller in awhile. You grow out as well as up. Do you want broader shoulders, or do you want to stay stuck with what you've got now?

**Cancer, Liver, Kidney Disease**

You hear all the time teenagers say “Well, my friends did it and they got big and nothing happened to them.” Really? How do you know? Have they been to a doctor and had their liver and kidney values checked? Just because a person looks okay on the outside doesn't mean that they don't already host serious problems on the inside. If treated improperly or in an untimely manner, liver and kidney damage can eventually be fatal.

**Impotence**

Your neuroendocrine system is still developing. Supplementing with hormones while you are still growing can potentially cause *permanent* impotence and fertility issues in teenagers. When you add testosterone, estrogen and a wealth of other synthetic androgens to your body it can cause problems with your normal testicular growth and function. Remember, some of these effects are more than just temporary.

**Gyno, or “Bitch Tits”**

Androgen usage in teens increases the risk of gyno. Gyno has already been known to happen naturally in many teenagers because of fluctuating hormones. When you add more hormones to the mix, you dramatically increase the problems. Remember once you have gyno, it's very hard to get rid of. Unless you take the proper precautions up front, you'll have to resort to surgery and go under the knife.

***Hair Loss, Acne, Prostate Dysfunction***


**Tracking Neurological Development**

[Maturation of the Adolescent Brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621648/) 

>Neuromorphological, neurochemical, neurophysiological, neurobehavioral, and neuropharmacological evidence suggests that the brain remains in its active state of maturation during adolescence. Such evidence supports the hypothesis that the adolescent brain is *structurally and functionally vulnerable* to environmental stress, risky behavior, drug addiction, impaired driving, and unprotected sex.   
>  
>Computed tomography and MRI studies also provide evidence in support of this hypothesis. Brain maturation occurs during adolescence due to a surge in the synthesis of sex hormones implicated in puberty including estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. *These sex hormones augment myelinogenesis and the development of the neurocircuitry involved in efficient neurocybernetics*. Although tubulinogenesis, axonogenesis, and synaptogenesis can occur during the prenatal and early postnatal periods, myelinogenesis involved in the insulation of axons remains under construction in adolescence. Sex hormones also significantly influence food intake and sleep requirements during puberty.   
>  
>In addition to dramatic changes in secondary sex characteristics, sex hormones influence learning, intelligence, memory, and behavior of adolescents. The development of excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission occurs earlier in the developing brain as compared to GABAergic neurotransmission, which makes the pediatric population susceptible to seizures. *The development and maturation of the prefrontal cortex occurs primarily during adolescence and is* **fully accomplished at the age of 25 years**. The development of the *prefrontal cortex* is very important for complex behavioral performance, as this region of the brain helps accomplish **executive brain functions**.

## Women & AAS

Just as seen in adolescents, the side effects seen in women can be **permanent**. AAS can lower voice, facial hair growth, and induce clitoral enlargement. For this reason, AAS administration to women must be used very cautiously, at more conservative doses, but is possible. 

For more information please visit the [Women's Wiki Page](/women.md) and visit r/steroidsxx for specialized advice for women.

## Tips For Interpreting Scientific Studies

The number one tip, is “*Who stands to gain from this?*” This is particularly relevant if you found the study quoted by some supplement site, for example.  You should also check at the end of the article to see if there is any disclosure of conflict of interest from the researchers. There should also be information on the source of funding. If it was funded commercially, and one or more of the authors have an interest, beware. Most good journals will cite these things.

You can also look at the reputation of the journal itself. There is a ranking system or journals, but without being a scientist, it is hard to know. For those wanting to read more see [Impact factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor).

Another factor of course is how relevant the research is. Was it in mice? Was it in elderly women? Was the study well designed to test what you want to know?

One interesting area is the reference section. Here you can find yourself valuable information on studies that might be more relevant to what you want. Throughout the text assertions are made that are backed up by prior research. This is then referred to the reference section.  PubMed is wonderful at this as there are related citations to the right side.
